## Investigation 1: Tableau Data Shaping with Python
*Presented April 17, 2018 at Metis*

This investigation shares recommendations for how to build a smoother connection between Tableau and Python, particularly with regards to data shaping. Tableau prefers data that is long and skinny, whereas `pandas` dataframes in Python are often wider and shorter. Some Python functionality can also be integrated directly into Tableau via the TabPy extension.

Suggested approach to this directory:
1. Review slides 1-5
2. At slide 6, open the .twbx (Tableau Packaged Workbook) file and follow directions in the captions
3. Review slides 7-9

If you do not have Tableau Desktop installed, you can view the workbook with Tableau Reader[https://www.tableau.com/products/reader] but will not be able to make changes.
