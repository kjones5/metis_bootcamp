      "Good morning! Just wanted to say good morning to you and also to send this clipping off out of the paper before it got lost. There are seven dens in this pack and you'll notice there were 43 arrowpoints awarded and 14 of those were from our den, so our boys shone like diamonds! We are going to make relief maps of North Dakota today. We are going to try to come home next weekend so be prepared, Daddy, with your life history! We are going to try to come home this past weekend but yours truly had that flu bug that Karen had, and I didn't dare get that many miles away from the bathroom. Richard started yesterday, so he has a monopoly on the basement bathroom and I hold the monopoly on the upstairs bathroom, and everyone moves when they see us coming. We can't come home while there's any chance of any of us having flu, because we have to be clean and clear enough to get near that baby. I think Karen is dying by degrees to see that baby gir!!I might as well give up on this! The phone has rang five times since I started this letter and now it's 11 o'clock so better get moving if Doug and I are going to have lunch and get the dinner and breakfast dishes done and then I have to get nine maps of North Dakota drawn out and salt and flour ready to moisten when the Cubs get here. We are having a pinewood derby this month at the pack meeting, too, so each boy is making a race car out of blocks of pinewood and then we have a run off in the den and the best one goes to the pack meeting. Hope to see you this weekend if everyone is over the bug. At least, we don't have any vomiting with it, but never saw food travel through so fast! Kinda knocks the zip out of you, though, after a few days of such high power digestion. Got to get busy! Love, 'Lizbeth Ann\n",

      "Good morning! Here we are at last in the wild and wintry northland! We got in here about 5:30 PM yesterday in pitch darkness. It had been dark then for a couple hours. Gets light about 7:30 AM. Now for our trip. Will start with our departure from the hostess house or thereabouts. Tried to call Uncle Leo's all day Monday and Tuesday and couldn't get them but finally got a hold of them on Wednesday, November 9 AM and they came to see us that PM. They're both looking good but still seem kinda jittery after the accident. We had a real nice visit with them. Tuesday, November 8 nite Lorraine and Dan and Kellen and their two came to see us. Danny Kay is the image of his daddy and kinda chubby. Bonnie is small and a very pretty little girl with big blue eyes and long blonde curls. Lorraine and Dan both look fine. Dan works with oil heaters installing and repairing about the same work as Bill Ronig does, I believe. Didn't see Mrs. Elmer Johnson, but Lorraine said that she still feels fine out here and has never had any more of those spells. She says her dad has aged a lot. Eugene Keller is in Kodiak, Alaska, in the Navy Air Force but don't know just where that is from here. Sergeant and Mrs. Potts and family were up to see us Tuesday night, too. They're stationed just a few miles from here. (From Seattle that is.) Now for our departure. We had to leave all our luggage tags and outside our door at 6:30 AM Thursday November 10. Then we all met in the lobby of the hostess house at 8:30 and government buses took us to the ship. As we got off the bus there were Filipino stewards from the ship standing there to carry all the babies aboard ship and help you locate your state room. Dependents all travel first class. We had two lower and two upper bunks and a davenport which made into a bed. Our room had five clothes closets, private bathroom with shower, toilet and wash bowl. Naturally this being my first experience on the ship, I was all eyes. The thing that struck me the funniest was the slant of the floor. They aren't built level but on a decided slant with the higher level towards the center of the boat. There was lots of drawer space, one big chest of drawers with seven drawers and three drawers under each of the two lower bunks and the davenport. The sendoff we got was very impressive, I thought. Almost everyone was up on deck and the army band played as we were towed out of port. Don't remember what the first songs were, but the last was Auld Lang Syne, and the one before that was Now Is The Hour. Gave me kind of a funny feeling to look out at all that endless expanse of water, which seemed to lead to nowhere, but we got here, so guess it led somewhere! As soon as the boat got underway we went back to our rooms and our room steward came with life preservers. Then there were a series of whistle toots and everybody donned their life preservers and proceeded up to B deck (we were down on C) to their designated boat station for fire drill. It's just a practice drill so that everyone will know where to go in case of emergency and so that people won't all clutter to one life boat. We had two drills, one the second day out. When we came onboard ship we were given a card so we know when to go to meals and which place at what table was yours. You kept the same place every meal. There was a nursery, too, where you took all babies that didn't eat regular meals. They had plenty of cribs, and high chairs and the mothers brought their babies in there 15 minutes before meal time and could feed them before they themselves went to eat. Your bottles were washed and formula made every day for you and there was baby food warmed up and ready to feed the babies when you went in the nursery. We were just two doors from the nursery and right next-door to the hospital. Also right across the aisle from the passenger laundry. Down the hall a ways was a children's playroom, complete with tables, chairs, lots of black boards, drinking fountain, toys, and a children's bathroom off of that. Dining room was at the end of the hall and talk about food!! Anything and everything you wanted. The last evening at sea is the captains dinner. Everyone spruces up a bit and the dining room is all decorated with streamers, balloons, etc. Beside each plate is a paper hat and a special menu with a picture of the Frederick Funston and the names of his crew. Those we got out to keep for souvenirs. That is also the time everyone tips their dining room steward. There was a library and several lounges up on the deck. Also a theater but yours truly didn't get much chance to frequent any\n",

      "Good morning my fine fader and mader!! Just took all the kids to vacation Bible school, so will take a few minutes to  tell you we are really not dead or haven't left the country. Mutt came home Tuesday 7th at 6:30 AM and left yesterday morning at 10. Sure hated to see him go again but we had a wonderful vacation while he was here. We went to Washington DC one morning and went through part of the Smithsonian Institute and the aquarium in the department of commerce. Saw Sheppard's capsule in the aerospace building and the Kitty Hawk of the Wright brothers, and the animals of every description in the main part of the Smithsonian. You could spend a couple days there and still not see all there is to see. Mutt and I went to DC alone early one morning and went to the Pentagon to look at his service records. Saw them all, and Silvernail's ER is still in there, but after seeing it, I can't see there was anything exactly derogatory in it, it just neglected to mention all the extra projects and jobs he's had and completed with high praise. Mutt talked by phone to the fellow in the WO promotion office and he said that they turned down fellows with over 20 years service because they thought they'd take the promotion and run. This doesn't make sense because Mutt is regular instead of reserve and the Air Force can hold him for 30 years if they desire. The fellow said there were a lot of burned up warrants and he felt they had a reason to be burned up, but once a promotion has been doled out, they can only take it away by court-martial. They can't tell you why you weren't selected, where you stood promotion-wise, what they judged on or anything, so you really can find out very little. After talking to that fellow, he called the man in charge of retirement and he said he thought Mutt would have little trouble getting retirement approved and also told him to try to arrange to get his eye operated on at once and they'd have to send him to Walter Reed and if they'd transfer him to the Department of Patients there, and Mutt would notify him, he'd have him out of service in three weeks. We went up to see Colonel Falletta in his office in the Pentagonwhile we were there. He and Mutt and Prottenglier worked together in Albuquerque. He asked what the h___ Mutt was doing here and when Mutt told him checking on retirement, he started telling him how much the service needed men like him, so before he went any further, Mutt  told him about the promotion list and why he was retiring. Colonel Falletta had his feet up on his desk and when he heard that Mutt didn't make the promotion, his feet hit the floor so fastI thought he was going to fall out of his chair! He says, wellllll after hearing that I guess I can save my speech! He's an old Texas boy and common as an old shoe (looks like that short one of the Abbet and Costello team) but is a brilliant fellow according to Mutt. Course he and Mutt were going back-and-forth with remember this time and what ever happened to so-and-so, and they caught up on a lot of fellows that one or the other had lost track of. Know they both enjoyed the visit and they both had some good laughs on memories of Albuquerque. We went back to DC another day and rode the elevator to the top of the Washington Monument and walked down!! Thought my knees would never quit bending even after I got out on the sidewalk. The view from the top of that is beautiful!! Mutt went to the Federal Aviation Agency to check on job qualifications, etc., while we toured the monument, and then we all went to the Lincoln Memorial and then to the wax museum and by the time we got back to the car, we were really beat! Still want to see the White House and the Capitol on the inside before we leave here. Traffic is terrific, though! We went to DC to a Sears store one day, too, and got the kids clothes for school (and three new dresses for me for my birthday!!). Mark and Doug had an extra good birthday because Daddy was home. They each had a cake and it was another one of those unplanned birthday parties before it was over. Had 26 people that finally got cake, ice cream, and punch or coffee! Started out with just the two girls across the hall, and the four kids next-door to them, and then the mamas came in and then the daddys came home from work, and then Rodney's, Richard's, and Mark's buddies heard there was cake and all came to visit! It was fun though and Mutt met all the neighbors (except the prostitutes next-door! I didn't introduce him to them!!!).  Saturday morning we drove to Annapolis to the Naval Academy so the boys could see that, and really lucked out! They were having a big parade and review for Change of Command and it was really impressive! We got there at 10:45 AM and the program and parade started at 11 AM. Don't know how often they change commands at an Academy, but we really hit it at the right time. We drove up towards Baltimore one day, too, and out to Fort Meade several times. Mutt had dinner with retired Colonel Davis (retired from Grand Forks in June '61) while I went commissarying at Fort Meade one day. At any rate, we did a little housekeeping except for eating and washing dishes while Mutt was home and it sure looks it today!! He and the boys were at the pool a couple hours every day and he got a nice suntan (burned, too, but where it's peeling, it's tan underneath!) and they really hung onto him and he looked like the Pied Piper every time he went out the door! He had a gang of boys at the ballpark playing baseball a couple days, too. Really utilized every minute he had and know he hated to head back, but left with a letter all written to the Secretary of the Air Force requesting immediate retirement and stating his reasons why. This will go (properly) through channels so will be endorsed by his CO at the site, the CO at Goose Bay Air Defense Command, then to Colorado Springs to be endorsed and then to the secretary of the Air Force and back to Mutt, so will likely take several months, but we at least know definitely now that he is going to retire (if they approve it and they'd better now!!) at least by April 1. As soon as he gets a retirement date, he can start checking on employment, but must have a definite date before anyone will even accept an application, which is understandable. Found out several other things about several of the WO's that made the promotion. Smith (at Grand Forks) was an alcoholic and supposed to work in weather, but came to work so drunk so often that he couldn't navigate nor do his work, so was sent to the motor pool to work where he didn't have to do any technical work. Albright, who was with us in South Carolina and visited us in Alubquerque and in Michigan and had same date of rank as Mutt but less years of service, had been thrown out of Alaska by the commander there because he would get along with no one and caused so much dissention among the personnel. He made W3, though. When Colonel Davis heard they made Kimbrell and not Mutt, his reply was, That d___ fellow never did anything but sit on his a__ the whole time he was in Grand Forks! Made him so mad, that he is writing a letter to Director of Personnel in DC, just to express his opinion! Says it will be his first act as a civilian, but it might help make them wake up and revise their promotional policies. At any rate, we've had a wonderful vacation, seen lots of the country, and know we'll all remember these few days a long, long time. Guess I've yakked long enough (an hour and a half), and wanted to wash my dirty wig before the kids come home, so guess I'd better go stick my head in the sink! Lots of love to both of you and will let you know what we hear on retirement. Betty\n",

      "Good morning, Mither! I'm under the drier again and there wasn't a pen handy so decided to grab a pencil and chat with you while I dry. I have a dental appointment at 10 and have errands to run all over the place. I cleaned out my closet yesterday and found 4 wool skirts that have been \"hanging\" waiting to be shortened. Took them to the tailor on base and they wanted $3.50 for each skirt, so I guess you know I brought them right back home again! I'll do it myself when I retire in Santa Monica! You know it just dawned on me that I think Marvin Myhre is working for SDC (some company Mutt is going to work for!). I have their “Granada Hills” address, if they’re still there. Will have to check with Leona while I’m there in Rugby. I moved Doug in with Rich last night so I can use Doug’s bedroom for packing and sorting. I have stuff torn up real good all over the place and have little piles of “don’t anybody touch” all over. Nobody touches either! They’re such nice people here! Doug was so excited last night. He called from his bedroom, “Mom, Mom, come here quick!” I about broke my neck getting in there and he was so excited and said, “Listen, Mom, listen!” I listened, but couldn’t figure out what he was talking about and finally he said, “Look! I’m breathing through my nose!” He hasn’t done that for over a month, so guess it was something to be excited about. He got a different antihistamine from the doctor last Monday and evidently it’s working. He got up looking so rested this morning. I’m sure he had a light asthma attack last Friday, and explained it to the doctor and he said he was sure that’s what it was, too. It’s the first time he’s ever done that. He says he’s getting a “C or C” in PE, too, because he just didn’t have enough air to run far enough. The classes are so large that the teachers just don’t have time to check to see if there’s a reason they can’t keep up. Mark’s graduation announcement came in last night so I cornered Mark and we got those out. Also got Becky’s and Donita’s graduation gifts off, so have Randy’s left and haven’t gotten his yet. Boys are harder to shop for than girls are, but I’ll get at that soon. I work Saturday and Sunday, go to a NORAD luncheon Monday noon in Novato, and I work Thursday and Friday (30 and 31) and then I’m through (working for money, that is!). Must go or I’ll miss my dental appointment. Time is creeping by fast and we’ll see you soon. Lots o’ love, Betty\n",

      "Good morning, Mother o’ mine. It’s a beautiful day! Look out your window. Is it beautiful there, too? Yup, I knew it was! Rich and Mark got home from work (Officer’s Club) at 12:45 AM and were back at work at 8:00 this morning. There’ a big swim meet here today and tomorrow at the officer’s pool (Napa, San Francisco, and whole Bay Area). They have 1900 entries so I’m sure the place will be jammed. The club has the refreshments to take care of for that, and then the boys go to the dining room from 4:30 PM till around 1 AM again so they’ll be pooped when they get home. Doug is still sleeping. He leaves at 5:30 AM tomorrow for Boy Scout Camp at Crescent Lake, Oregon (halfway between Medford & Eugene, but farther inland in highway 99) for two weeks. His buddy from across the street is going, too. It’s his first trip away from home for any length of time, but right now he’s all “hopped up” to go. He needed a summer uniform so I proceeded to cut down one that the twins and Mark had worn when they went into Scouts at his age. Wellllll, I took them in over two inches in the waist and seat and practically remade the whole pair of pants. He’s still wearing size 10 walking shorts (even if he will be 12 next month) but is growing taller. He’s 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 75 pounds and doesn’t look thin. Wears size 12 shirts, but just doesn’t have any waist and behind to hold his britches up! Karen called a couple nights ago. They moved into a smaller apartment right by the college. (Cheaper, too, $85 instead of $125 a month). Jim is working. Doctor didn’t want him to go to work yet, but she said he couldn’t stand it any longer. His ankle is still swollen but he keeps it wrapped. He’s driving a glass company truck out of LA and is gone from Monday to Friday. They’re putting his check in the bank and then he’s going back to school full time this fall. He called from San Lorenzo one day and you might know, I was at the commissary, but Doug talked to him. Karen is coming up here for a week before school starts (Jim’s last week on the road) and then he will finish his job, come up here for a few days and they’ll fly home again. Rod called Sunday. They let them call home that day. Some sort of special privilege. He tried out for the Academy Church Choir and he made it! Said they took 93 “4th classmen” (that’s him). There are 1035 in his class, so he feels he was real lucky to make it. Haven’t heard from him since Sunday but they were to go out on bivouac Monday for three weeks so s’pose we won’t hear for awhile. He says it’s rough but he still likes it. He’s planning on Rich making it next year. Rich is all registered, etc. at College of Marin here and will stay home and commute to school. Took the Civic Service exam again for the Air Force Academy so all the paperwork starts over again. He’s sure determined he’s going to make it this time! Works with weights three days a week and thinks his knee is getting quite a bit stronger. Mutt is in Portland (or Corvallis) and will be home the 27th. He thinks his August trip is going to be canceled and that will suit us both fine! He was supposed to be gone August 2 to 22 and what with Doug gone and the boys working… egads!! Oh, well, there’s still Tina! Went over to the Convalescent Hospital to pick up my check the other evening, and talked to a nurse on 3-11 shift. She said that the place had been crawling with inspection teams and the roof was about to blow off something. Sure glad I got out of there when I did. Doug was with me and we stopped to visit several of the patients and they were so thrilled I stopped. The patients are nice and aren’t aware of the crooked stuff going on in the office or the investigations, etc, but are aware that the help doesn’t stay long and they wonder why. It’s a lovely new building and could be so nice! I enjoyed the patients so much, miss the job, but sure don’t want to get involved in a legal entanglement. Reckon I’d better get moving! See the mop and bucket sitting right here where I left it when the boys came in with buddies for lunch, just as I finished mopping the kitchen floor! The mop and bucket never got any farther and the dining area never got mopped! Here comes that lazy Doug looking for breakfast! He and I are going to try to get in to see Doctor Zhivago at the theater this afternoon. Runs from 2:45 to 6:30 so is a long movie. I rarely go to a movie. Think I’ve been twice and we’ve been in this house 14 months, but we decided we’d like to see this so we’ll give it a try. Must go feed the starving man! Much, much love from us all, Betty, Doug, and Tina\n",

      "Dearest Mutt, This will probably be a book before I’m through, but you don’t mind, I’m sure. Haven’t much good news for you this time. Went to see Doctor Fox yesterday and the baby is turned wrong again and the head is up by my ribs. It was pretty discouraging news, but nothing can be done about it now, as it’s too late in the game to try to turn it. It won’t make any difference except that I’ll probably go till the 15th of August. Pleasant thought, isn’t it? I had hoped we could be back together by then, but it looks like it will be longer than we had figured on. I asked him how soon I could travel and he said if the baby should turn around, which he doesn’t think will happen, then I could go in about two weeks after the delivery. If the baby comes breech, then I’ll have more stitches and wouldn’t be able to travel for at least three weeks or more, so that’ll probably make it September before I get out of here. As for a diaphragm they’re almost 100% foolproof. Says as long as we used it right we wouldn’t have to worry about increasing our family any more. Everything else is fine. Blood getting up to par gradually and urine is okay. Blood pressure and everything else is okay, too. So much for that. Stopped at the bank and got our bank statement. Also cashed and deposited Chacon’s check. Our bank balance at present is $181.88. That’s what it will read when all the checks get in, anyway. Paid $30 on the grocery bill this month. Pop’s bill was $106 at Bickler’s this month, but Mom has been canning so that included 100 pounds of sugar ($10), 1 crate of peaches and cherries, and then Catherine and Buzz and 2 kids were here for a couple days, too, so that made the bill bigger. Helen was at the clinic yesterday, too, and guess what ails her!! Yep, she’s pregnant again. Her blood is up good this time and Doctor C.G. Johnson said there was no reason why she shouldn’t carry this one through. She’s due March 25 and are they excited. Sure hope she goes through okay this time. She feels fine and weighs 102 pounds now, which is more than she has weighed for several years, so she’s got a good chance of making a go of it this time. Now I know what to do with my maternity clothes when I leave, too. Honey, disregard that letter I wrote the other day about changing our “girls” name. I was kinda down in the dumps that day and so cross I had to watch myself all day to keep from biting somebody’s head off and every time I said something about “Frances” I’d have to explain “Frances Maudeen” and it just got my goat. Just one of those nerve wracking pregnant days when everything upsets me. I’ve had quite a few of them the last few days, but think it’s just the impatience of waiting to get it over with, everyday hoping this is the day and then nothing happens. I miss you so darn much, too, and when day after day goes by I’m still sitting here waiting for action I know it will be just that much longer before I can see you again. Gruesome thoughts, aren’t they? I’ve been crocheting a bonnet to go with the sweater and booties so should finish that any day now. I’ve forgotten to get belly binders for the twerp, but am just going to cut a few out of flannel instead of buying them. How was the ball game?? Am so glad you went, because you need something to look at besides barracks walls once in a while. I don’t worry about you spending your time at the bar, Honey, because I have lots of faith in your will power to stay away from there now, and it’s such a relief not to have that worry. It’s been a year now, and what a wonderful year!! Just took time out to check on our little family. The babies are in the playpen happy as larks and Karen is digging dirt and singing away. She sure misses you. I hear, “Is our baby at the hospital yet, so my Daddy can come home?”. That is asked at least once a day and sometimes six or seven times. Think she’s given up hope that it’s ever going to get here. Yippee!! Sadie just brought me a letter from T/Sgt. Francis Jones. Know him! Egads. What scandal!! What in the world ever hit the 606th that it got that rough? Can just see that Joe telling the officers off. Bet that was a one man side show in itself, cuz he was strictly a character. Couldn’t help but like him even if I did blame him for some of the sprees you two had, but Joe’s a good egg, anyway. Wonder if they didn’t adopt a war orphan, seeing the birth announcement come from Germany. Well, it’s 6:30 PM now. Guess I’d better get on the beam. We washed clothes this morning and they’re ready to be brought in, Mom’s cleaning the basement, Margie just came back from the clinic after having her ears cleaned out and she can hear again, Sadie just got home from work, Pop just came from downstairs, and the kids are in the house, so no use trying to write any more. Will keep you posted what “pops” here. Love from us all, Betty. PS Aren’t the pictures good? Gotta take our two little sheep down to Barb Liming and get them sheared one of these days. They sure look wooly.\n",

      "Dear Mom. Well, here we are in “y’all come” country. Left Riverside Monday morning and have sailed right along. Just called the boys and Mark said he ate cereal out of a mixing bowl this morning because all the cereal bowls are dirty! By the time I get home next Tuesday, they’ll be eating out of the sink. Mark gets his Eagle Scout award presented at a ceremony tomorrow night and Doug gets his “Start” award, and we should be there, but Karen and Jim are going to be their parents! We should get to Petersburg, Virginia Friday and then I fly back to Riverside Tuesday. That gives us a couple days to look the area over and check on school for Doug, etc etc etc. We’ve really enjoyed the trip so far. Louisiana has horrible roads, but Texas had beautiful roads. Am anxious to see Virginia now. Will write when I get home. Lots o’ love, Betty\n",

      "Good morning, Mither! Mark and Doug are gone and Rich doesn’t get up until 9 this morning. Mark came home from classes at 11 AM Friday with a temp of 101.6 and it was 103 degrees all day Saturday and the doctor says “flu”, so he’s back to school today. He’s still blowing his nose like mad, and coughing a little, but his temp was normal all day yesterday and he even “looks” like Mark today. Yesterday the Scouts had a meeting here at 10 AM and the Scoutmaster was here till 4 PM. He’s a young fellow, about 25, getting married December 21, and Mark is his assistant Scoutmaster and I could tell Ed just didn’t want to go back to his barracks. He’s a nice young man and really good with the Scouts. Karen and Jim were over Sunday evening and we just gabbed and gabbed. Jim plans to go to Long Beach State College next year, so they’ll be moving next summer. It sure has been nice to have them close this year. Mutt is supposed to find out this week sometime about where his job will be and we’re sure anxious! He is in an apartment alone and much happier with this than the other arrangement he had. This little apartment is so clean, and it’s much quieter, and then he doesn’t have Hal to contend with. That man was the sloppiest, dirty fellow and it’s hard to imagine him a lieutenant colonel, but he was. Rich came home from classes yesterday all elated! He was really sweating out his “statistics” class midterm and got it back yesterday with an “A” on it, so he was really tickled. He’s gotten a B and a B-plus and this A on his midterms but only got a C-minus on his Italian midterm. He’s taking that on a “pass-fail”, so doesn’t worry too much about it, but sure works hard on that course. They’re allowed to take one course on a “pass-fail” basis and if they pass it, they still get credit for it but the grade isn’t figured into the grade point average, and if they fail it, it doesn’t go on their record as a fail. He was debating on whether to take “stats” or “Italian” on pass-fail and he evidently picked the right one. Peggy is coming down for Thanksgiving. He thinks he’s convinced her to stay in nursing school. I sure hope so, because she’s getting real good grades and she just misses Rich and I can understand that, too. Rich is going to Berkeley next year, so he will be able to see her on weekends, so then she will be happy. Mark came home from Terra Linda Homecoming and he says “Now I think I’m in love,” and I said, “Oh, no, not another one!” and he just chuckled! He’s such a nut, I can’t imagine him loving one. We had our conference with Mr. Airey and the accordion salesman last Saturday and wheeeeee, by paying $60.28 a month for 3 years and trading in Doug’s accordion we could get him the big accordion and amplifier. They’d allow us $271.75 for Doug’s accordion and we’d still have to pay $2170.08, so we said, “No, thank you.” It includes “teacher training” in Santa Ana on Saturdays, but we won’t be here to take advantage of that. The salesman said, “Well, I’ll bring over an accordion and amp from Santa Ana this week, anyway, and you’ll change your mind and buy it anyway this week.” He’s so darned “pushy” and I balk like a mule at a salesman like that! The only advantage this expensive accordion has is the amplification, and about three more switches to change the sound, and the keyboard is a faster action, so the keys come back up quicker and it’s easier to play faster, but even Doug thought that was way too much money for the difference in the machine. If we were going to stay here with Mr. Airey for three years, it might be worth it, but not otherwise. These darned salesmen talk so fast and furious that the sum total doesn’t hit you till after you’re home and put it on paper. I always think it’s a good idea to get the figures, come home and think it over at least 24 hours and then decide. We’ve eliminated a lot of high pressure buys that way. They say, “It’s only ‘so much’ a month” and it doesn’t sound so bad, until you add on their carrying charges and that’s a different picture! Well, I reckon I’d better get dressed and get out of here. Gotta go to the bank to deposit Rich’s check for him and get some money for us in here at this house. Have a kitchen full of dirty dishes, too. I went to bed (with dishes stacked in the sink) last night and that was a mistake. It’s such a mess in the morning, but can’t blame anyone but me! I sure did things differently when I was working! Got a lot more stuff done, but didn’t do the “fun projects” I do now. Didn’t sit around till 10 AM in my robe and gown, either! Guess I need someone to say, “Hurry, Betty!” Gotta get busy. I’ll even miss the mailman if I keep this up! Thanks for listening and lots o’ love, Betty\n",

      "Good morning, Mom. Looks like it’s going to be a pretty day. The sun is shining and there’s a cool breeze, but I sure miss the birds. You just hear “people” noises here, like trucks and cars and kids and dogs, but no birds. We had the nicest trip to San Rafael to see the kids. Northern California (especially the Mount Shasta area) is so pretty now, but guess they really get the snow in the winter, too. We spent one night at the Holiday Inn where Mark works “room service.” He came knocking on our door about 10 AM and when I opened it he said, “Excuse me, Lady, but I have to use your bathroom.” I told him that we’d never had “room service” like that before and he just laughed. Rich came over Friday after class (PM) and then the boys and Dad went to the stock car races in Petaluma Friday night. We went to see Winnie and Emory (Mutt’s cousins) Saturday PM. They’re the best people. That Winnie is about 64, weighs about 95 pounds and just bubbles with energy. Emory was head of California State Highway Patrol for quite a few years before he retired. He has diabetes, so has lost some weight since we saw him last, but he says he feels good and just can’t eat as much anymore, but says he doesn’t miss all the extra stuff he was eating before. Doug is still sleeping. He’s “14” today and Mark is 19. I’m going to make a small birthday cake for Doug and then will make one for Mark when he gets home at the end of the month. Took Doug to Wards yesterday and he got a new shirt, some “flared leg trousers and a brown suede belt and he thinks he’s the sharpest thing in town. Even came home and polished his shoes so they’d look good and then he sat here all spruced up and waited for Mutt to come home from work. Most of the trousers Doug’s size have longer legs and if you shorten them, you lose the “taper,” and these had 25.5 inch inseam instead of 28 inch so fit perfect. (Now watch the son of a gun grow and you can’t lengthen these either.) Got Doug all set in school. He’s going to be taking English, Spanish I, Biology, Algebra, PE, and Frosh Choir. He still says he wants to be a doctor, so I asked him if he planned to sing his patients back to health, since he’s taking choir and he said, “Sure.” School starts September 3. Got him lined up with an orthodontist (only one in town) and “visited” him yesterday. Today we have a 1 PM appointment with an accordion teacher. I’m still thinking seriously about seeing if I can find part-time work after school starts. S’pose Maria is in Minneapolis now. I would think that would be very interesting. Doris Chabot’s daughter is taking a similar course, I guess, in Ashland, Oregon. I think she said Debbie goes to St. Louis, Missouri for four weeks after she finishes in Ashland. Got a letter from our neighbors in Virginia and the Kettlewell’s (he’s the fellow with no legs) had a 10.5 pound son on August 6. She was due the same time Sadie is. Sure a good thing she didn’t go any longer or she’d have had an elephant! Everyone was kidding Pat and Don (Kettlewell) so, and telling them that Pat looked like she was going to have twins, and she really was huge, much bigger than Sadie is. Am sure they’re glad it’s just one, though, especially with Don and his Buerger’s disease. Mom, do you remember the Prottenglier’s? They were stationed with us in Albuquerque and then were at Minot when we were at Grand Forks. He was a radio announcer at Minot and they were at a picnic we had in Minot one summer (1959??) (must have been July because I made doll birthday cake for Mona and Maria and brought them to the picnic). We went to their apartment a little while after the picnic. Gloria & Punk (or “Paul Arthur” as he’s called on radio) had 5 boys. Well, anyway, while we were at Frank’s I got Punk’s mother’s address out of the Minneapolis phone directory and wrote her when we got here. Was a bit shocked when I got her letter and found out they’re divorced and Punk married a Minot divorcee with a 13-year-old son in 1962. Gloria has the 5 boys and is still in Billings, Montana where they went from Minot. Punk and Darlene are in Florida and both work for a radio station there. We had lost track of them since they were in Minot. Their oldest boy has a full scholarship to Stanford, so must be a pretty brith boy. He’s the same age as Mark. Then they have boys 17, 16, 14, and 12. Anyway, we felt pretty badly when we heard about it. It must be awfully hard on the boys with no father around and also hard for Gloria to raise 5 boys by herself. The boys take turns going to visit their Dad, one boy each summer so that means they see him once every 5 years!! The 17-year-old had trouble of some sort in school last year, so has to repeat his junior year, so there’ll be 2 in junior class this year. We got a letter from Punk this week. I wrote to Gloria, but haven’t heard from her, and Punk’s mother sent him our address and he wrote straight away. I’d rather hear from Gloria, though. Well, I gotta get moving. I never know when to shut up when I start talking to you! Just keep going on and on. Much love, Betty\n",
