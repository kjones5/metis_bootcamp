Your letter came about an hour ago, Mom. The telegram came Sunday. Your letter, telling that Duane was sick, came Monday after the telegram got here. Yes, I broke our engagement, but I never dreamed that Duane would die and add that much more sorrow to Fay's already loaded mind. Mom, I loved Fay very much when I accepted my ring, and had every intention of marrying him then, but I know now that I don't love him. All the while he was gone, I was looking forward to seeing him again, feeling sure that I would still love him and that everything would work out all right for the two of us, but when I came home from the hospital from the nurses meeting and met him at our apartment door, well, it was like meeting a perfect stranger. I don't really think that he has changed at all. He is still the same sweet fellow he was, but Mom, I don't love him! I tried to tell myself, ""You've got to love him, Betty, think of what he's gone through, and how he's looked forward to seeing you again"", but try as I could, I just couldn't tell him that I still loved him as much as before, because somehow I knew I didn't. Then I thought of one thing you've told us time and time again, ""Don't string a man along. If you don't love him, don't tell him you do."" Then I tried to figure out what to do. Should I let it go for awhile? Wait until you've seen him at least several more times so you'll have time to get really acquainted again?? Break it up now?? I decided to wait awhile. Then he was here several times and it just wasn't any different. There just seemed to be that wall between us and I felt that I didn't belong to him. It seemed that I wasn't playing fair by having him come and see me again and again and keeping his hopes sky-high, when I felt that it would never be the real thing with us. He felt too that things just weren't the same now as when he left. We talked it over and then I gave his ring back. No, it wasn't the easiest thing to do after dreaming and planning for almost two years!! It hurt plenty!! But, I still feel that I did the right thing, although I think now that I should have waited until after Christmas with the way things stand now. I had saved all my days off until he came home, so I had three or four accumulated by the time he got here, so I had two Sundays off when he was here. It was a week ago last Saturday that I gave him his ring. I had the next Sunday and Monday off, too, but of course I didn't see him Sunday. Frances went to church Sunday morning, but, well, I supposed might as well tell you why I didn't go with her. It was just because my eyes were so swollen from crying all night and I had a terrific headache. No, I'm not telling you this for sympathy sake, because it was all my own doings and I'm not looking for sympathy. I don't want any of it. All I know is that I don't love him now. I know I did two years ago, and perhaps if I had waited longer before I broke the engagement, then maybe I'd have learned to love him again, but I just don't know for sure. I just can't figure myself out. First there was Art Lien, my high school heartthrob that Daddy disapproved of and I'm glad now that that was broken up. Then there was Leslie. I didn't love him, but he was overseas and I was the girl he dreamed about until he was sure he loved me, but I thought of him more as a good friend. Especially after I met Fay. Then came Fay. Yes, I really believe that I did love him, but I don't now. Ah yes, and Buster! That one I can't figure out. I didn't give him any reason to think of me as any more than a ""sister"". I told him that he could never figure in my life and that I wanted him to understand that and remember it. But what does he do?? Writes me about 7 or 8 letters and several postcards between here and North Dakota and more when he got to Great Falls. But does he remember what I told him, no!!! He writes and practically (although not in the exact words) asks me to marry him. Honest!!! I don't try to string them along!! I know that in one letter home, Frances gave you the impression that I had strung bUster along and that she wished that Fay would come home and straighten me out, and that I ran around so much. But here is one thing she didn't mention or maybe she doesn't realize it, but since she came out here, we've run around twice, or three or four times as much as I did before she came out here. You see, I was afraid she'd get homesick, and when I saw that she might be getting a little homesick I'd suggest a show or something. If I hadn't taken her out or double dated with her she just wouldn't ever have gone anyplace because you know as well as I do that it wouldn't have been safe to let a girl go out alone at night here and besides that she wouldn't have wanted to go out alone. Here's what we usually did. Monday nights we're almost always home. She usually washed clothes or cleaned our house. Tuesday nights Sib and I leave about 6:30 to go to night school and don't get home till 9:30 or 9:45. Frances stays home. Wednesday nights there's a dance downtown at the Municipal Auditorium. She usually liked to go and I enjoy dancing, too, so I can't say that it was always just because she was here. Thursday, night school again and Friday we often double-dated. It was just to a show, lunch after the show and right home. It was always strictly on the level and I always told the fellow about Fay and that we were going to get married when he came home. Sometimes we'd let the kids come up here and we'd make coffee and have lunch here instead of eating uptown at the jammed restaurants, but there was nothing wrong with that and they were always out of here by midnight. They all appreciate so much the fact that we don't drink or smoke and are decent girls and it really means a lot to fellows just to sit and talk, read the funnies, or listen to the radio instead of going into a bar and seeing a girl get tipsy! I never felt that I was untrue to Fay by merely going to a show or drinking a cup of coffee with another fellow and I always told them how much I loved Fay. We never went to the dances with anyone. It was always just Frances and I and if anyone wanted to come and take us we'd just tell them ""no"" and that we'd see them at the dance when we got there. Oftentimes a couple of nice soldiers would walk home with us, but there was nothing wrong with that! I was engaged and I told them that I loved him very much. I'm usually home here by 4:00 and Sib gets here about 5:30 and Frances about 6 now, but she usually got home about 5:00 before. Everything is closed at 5:30, so it was up to me to buy the groceries, pay the light and gas bills, take books back to the library, etc. After running on duty all day, I'd feel so tired that I'd think I couldn't take another step. Then Frances would come home, and if it was Wednesday or Saturday she'd suggest that we go to the dance. Well, that got to be a routine so that it was just taken for granted that we go to the dance every Wednesday and Saturday night. Many and many a time I never told her just how tired I was, because I felt it was my duty to take her a few places, because I was the one who talked her into coming out here, and I feel that it's my place to see to it that she gets around and sees some of the places of interest, and does something to keep her interested and not homesick. When you write back, don't mention it because I don't want her to know that I go just because I feel it's my duty a lot of the time. I enjoy going with her more than I do with any fellows and when she and I go alone we have as much fun and people can't get over the fact that we're sisters and get along as well as we do. But back to the Baukols, I feel so sorry for Mrs. Baukol because I think she is the sweetest little lady and it seems that they have had more than their share of hard knocks in the last few months, and now my breaking off our engagement makes it that much worse. I don't love him, though. I did for the past two years but I'm sure I don't love him now. I had no idea anything was going to happen to Duane or I wouldn't have broken the engagement now, but how was I to know?? I don't go around hurting people deliberately or breaking hearts just for the joy of seeing them crumble!! Because there's no joy in that. I know I've broken hearts, and maybe sometimes it could have been avoided if I had tried hard enough, I just don't know. I didn't want to hurt Fay any more than you wanted to see him hurt. That is why I broke the engagement now. It was either one way or the other. Was I to tell him I loved him when I felt that I didn't and keep him thinking that for several more months while he made more plans for the future and probably gotten to loving me more and then finally tell him that for that period of time I hadn't loved him and was just keeping it up to make him think I loved him??? Or was I to break it now and quit stringing him and possibly regret it later or possibly feel later that I had done right by breaking it now? All I know was that I don't love him now and I couldn't look him in the eye and say, ""I love you"" when I really didn't!! Just what was I to do??? Wellll, I did what I thought was best - I broke our engagement. How was I to know that his only brother was going to die?? A fine Christmas he will have. No girl, no brother!! Yes, I'm not so hard-hearted that I don't feel all that! It's not the best feeling in the world to think that you have spoiled a man's Christmas that he has dreamed of for months while the shells buzzed by and he fought for a girl back him who discovered she didn't love him and he still loved her. What should I do??? Marry him when I'm sure I don't love him, and try to make him happy at least for Christmas?? Mom and Daddy, I'm puzzled, but I really feel that I did the right thing by breaking the engagement when I don't love him. I had no way of knowing that Duane was so near death or I would have waited a while. Your estimation of Fay is absolutely right, he's wonderful, but I don't love him as I used to. Must close this book now, and turn over a new leaf. I hope I never have to come home to you like Esther Ostrem as you mentioned, but please don't feel that I'm a heartbreaker and break people's hearts intentionally. Loving you with all my heart and hoping I won't be bringing any more disappointments your way again. All my love, Betty.",Dearest Mom and Daddy. ,"Your letter came about an hour ago, Mom.

Mom your super-duper letters came, so will answer them right away. First of all I'll start by answering the questions you asked. 1, Mutt will be in the service 1.5 years more, unless such a thing happens that he will be able to buy out before then. (The chances are slim for the latter.) 2, What do I mean when I say we may go to Georgia to live for awhile?? Well, I'm leaving for Texas the 3rd and will arrive there the 4th. We'll be in Texas till the latter part of November and then he is being transferred to Georgia so I'm going along, sooo there is no ""may"" about it now. He has applied for his 58 days and soooo we're keeping our fingers crossed that we'll get that so we can make it to North Dakota for Christmas. 3, Does he intend to stay in the army??? Not any longer than necessary. 4, As a civilian he will work for the airlines (TWA). 5, Will we live in California?? No definite plans made along that line. 6, Is Sib sewing little things?? Yes. So is Grandma!!! (For Sib's!) 7, Has Mutt been overseas?? Yes, he served overseas in Africa, India, Panama, Australia, Tinian Islands, and Japan. He was a Radar Operator on B-29s with the 20th Air Force. My little man is authorized to wear the following ribbons and medals. 1, Air medal with 2 oak leaf clusters. 2, Good conduct ribbon. 3, Victory ribbon. 4, Occupation of Japan ribbon. 5, Southwest Pacific Asiatic Campaign ribbon with three bronze battle stars. 6, European and Middle East Campaign ribbon. 7, Pre-Pearl Harbor ribbon. 8, American Theater of Operations ribbon. 9, Presidential Unit Citation. There!! Now you know that much. Let's see, where was I. Oh yes, question number 9. 9, He is the son of Mr and Mrs Walter H Jones of 401 Maurer Ave, Porterville, California. 10, What church does he belong to?? His folks belong to the ""First Christian Church"", but he has not been much of a church-goer. However, he has been going to church at the base since we were married. But I guess that's enough of the tales of my little man for awhile. Oh, by the way, how did things turn out as to what was planned for Wednesday night, Pat?? Hope it was a big success. I surely would like to see Uncle Sig and Aunt Numidia. I'm going to investigate at the Mission Inn and see if I can find any trace of Malfred. If she's there I should be able to track her down. I've packed Fritzie's typewriter and will try to get both the trunk and that off to her on Saturday. I'm so busy pack, pack, packing and wondering what to do with this and that and the other thing, that I don't know whether I'm coming or going. I was invited to a luncheon and a farewell party for Alberta Graf that works in Post Engineers or at least that's what I was told and it never dawned on me but what that was what it was, then just before lunch was served the kids presented me with a beautiful alloy steel skillet with one of those tight fitting covers, and also a pair of pillow cases from Mary and Bob Harte. Last night Gwenie and Lorna invited Sib and Louis and I over and they had never given Sib and Louis a wedding present, so they gave them (Sib and Louis) a pretty cake plate, and Jonesie and I got the cutest set of creamer and sugar. The sugar container is the gingham clog and there's a hole in the top of his head for the sugar to come out, and the calico cat is the cream pitcher and the cream comes out the mouth and the tail is the handle (drawing). Hmm I'm quite an artist. I've gotta go to bed, though, and get some beauty sleep. Goodness knows I need it! I've been having quite a bit of trouble with my bum ear. It's been aching since a week ago yesterday but I'm under doctor's care so it should clear up pretty soon. The canal is so small that it's kinda hard for them to see much, but it is quite a bit better than it was a week ago, so I guess ""time"" is the medicine. Once again, I must scoot to bed, soooo once again, lots of love (can't send it ""all"" anymore), Betty. PS Yes, Helen, I'm really gonna write to you, but likely as not it won't be till we get to Texas. I've just got so much to do and so very few hours.

My little man is authorized to wear the following ribbons and medals. 1, Air medal with 2 oak leaf clusters. 2, Good conduct ribbon. 3, Victory ribbon. 4, Occupation of Japan ribbon. 5, Southwest Pacific Asiatic Campaign ribbon with three bronze battle stars. 6, European and Middle East Campaign ribbon. 7, Pre-Pearl Harbor ribbon. 8, American Theater of Operations ribbon. 9, Presidential Unit Citation. There!! Now you know that much. Let's see, where was I. Oh yes, question number 9. 9, He is the son of Mr and Mrs Walter H Jones of 401 Maurer Ave, Porterville, California. 10, What church does he belong to?? His folks belong to the ""First Christian Church"", but he has not been much of a church-goer. However, he has been going to church at the base since we were married. But I guess that's enough of the tales of my little man for awhile. Oh, by the way, how did things turn out as to what was planned for Wednesday night, Pat?? Hope it was a big success. I surely would like to see Uncle Sig and Aunt Numidia. I'm going to investigate at the Mission Inn and see if I can find any trace of Malfred. If she's there I should be able to track her down. I've packed Fritzie's typewriter and will try to get both the trunk and that off to her on Saturday. I'm so busy pack, pack, packing and wondering what to do with this and that and the other thing, that I don't know whether I'm coming or going. I was invited to a luncheon and a farewell party for Alberta Graf that works in Post Engineers or at least that's what I was told and it never dawned on me but what that was what it was, then just before lunch was served the kids presented me with a beautiful alloy steel skillet with one of those tight fitting covers, and also a pair of pillow cases from Mary and Bob Harte. Last night Gwenie and Lorna invited Sib and Louis and I over and they had never given Sib and Louis a wedding present, so they gave them (Sib and Louis) a pretty cake plate, and Jonesie and I got the cutest set of creamer and sugar. The sugar container is the gingham clog and there's a hole in the top of his head for the sugar to come out, and the calico cat is the cream pitcher and the cream comes out the mouth and the tail is the handle (drawing). Hmm I'm quite an artist. I've gotta go to bed, though, and get some beauty sleep. Goodness knows I need it! I've been having quite a bit of trouble with my bum ear. It's been aching since a week ago yesterday but I'm under doctor's care so it should clear up pretty soon. The canal is so small that it's kinda hard for them to see much, but it is quite a bit better than it was a week ago, so I guess ""time"" is the medicine. PS Yes, Helen, I'm really gonna write to you, but likely as not it won't be till we get to Texas. I've just got so much to do and so very few hours.

I called Major Miller's folks last night and talked to his mother. Major Miller had asked me if I would call them and tell them that he and Colonel Schultz were going to fly down here to see them sometime in the very near future. She wants us to come out and see them before we leave here, so we'll have to see what we can do about it. Oh, forgot to tell you about our apartment. It's downstairs and is like this (drawing). Guess you can get the general idea of it. It's a cute little place and I could just see it if Mom would get her hands in here!! Oh, yes, there are cupboards above and below the sink and a big mirror above the chest of drawers.

We got your super-duper letter yesterday, Mom, so will answer it this morning. I just sent my little man off for the day. He leaves about 7:30 and is supposed to get home about 5:30 but last night he had to work until 10:00 and didn't get home until 11:00. The fellow he rides to work with came over at 5:30 and said that he wouldn't be home till 7:30 soooo I watched and waited and waited and watched and no Daddy coming!! The poor little guy was soooo tired when he got home, too. He brought the letter from you, Mom, 2 letters to me from him that had been returned from Riverside, some Lux, and 20 packages of Dentyne gum, soooo I've got lots of reading material for today. Oh, yes, and the Riverside Press. I had a busy day yesterday. I really cleaned house here. Washed the rest of the windows, all the woodwork, mopboards, and the floors, also washed clothes, cleaned cupboards, and went shopping in Yoleta with Ann Michaels, a captain's wife who lives next door in the court here. She's from Cleveland, Ohio, and is very nice. She's going into El Paso this afternoon to get some of my hubby's clothes that his mother expressed to him ages ago and they got lost someplace en route and have finally caught up with him. A tractor pulling a hayrack-like-box full of raw cotton just drove by. I was out and inspected a field of cotton here, because it's the first time I've ever seen cotton growing and it's really interesting stuff. I never realized before just how tight the seeds grow right into the cotton balls, and so many seeds to each ball! The raw cotton looks and feels just like raw wool, except for the seeds in the cotton. I think I forgot to tell you that our court is just across the street from the Yoleta High School and the physical education grounds are right next to the street, so I get a ringside seat here all day. The kids flock in from every direction and in the morning sunlight it looks just like a flower garden on parade. They have a big football stadium, too, and there's a game there Friday night, and my homey says if I'm a good girl he will take me to the game, soooo I'm being a very, very good girl. Sure do love that little man of mine, and we're so happy together. I notice more of Daddy's characteristics about him every day, and that's good, good, good, I'll have you know! So the folks around there sorta surprised you, did they?? You mean that Daddy didn't even catch on, like he did when they had the farewell party for you on the farm??? That was pretty good, wasn't it?? If they write it up in the paper, would you send us the paper, please? You see, we have a scrapbook started and it is entitled, ""Keeping up with the Francis E Joneses"". I hope I can keep up with it, because it will be fun to have later on. (There goes another hayrack load of cotton and a big load of baled hay!) Well, guess I'd better go and see if Ann is up, and then wash my breakfast dishes, iron my curtains, make my bed, and then I've got to write to Mother Jones today, too.

I'm lying on my tummy on the bed, so if you can figure this handwriting out, you'll be doing a wonderful job. The cake, preserves, and the pictures arrived the day before yesterday, and oooooh those twinsets are darling. I just wished I could have picked them up and squeezed ‘em tight!!! Sure wish we could see them before they get too big. I suppose they'll be walking before we get home, though. Buttttttt we'll be there as soon as we can make it. This old guy by the name of Uncle Sam, sorta has us under his thumb, but I don't mind a bit, because I've never been happier in my life than I have the past month and a half. But I'd better not start in on that again. November 1. Here I am again. I think this will be a book before I get through, but nevertheless here goes. On the twenty-first of October Sergeant Kocian and his wife came back to claim their apartment (we were only using it while they were on furlough) and so we moved into another court. It was very nice, buttttt was $3.50 a day and we were eating out sooooo we couldn't afford that kind of living long. Then the next day when my man had gone to work I proceeded to look for a place to live. I started at 10 AM and walked till 4:30 PM and then came home, because I knew my man would be home about 5:00 sooooo the next day I started again, this time at 9 AM, but I got a taxi and the driver was an ex-GI who knew El Paso pretty well, soooooo we stopped here and there and no luck so finally he said, ""I know a lady who has an apartment and she's a good friend of mine and they're very nice people"". Sooooo he drove up to a house, and even went to the door and introduced the lady and I (by the way, her name is Mrs Jones) and we can get her apartment tomorrow if we want it, but I'm not going to take it now. Well, then we stopped and talked to another lady he knew (Mrs Jenkins about 58 or 60 years old) and she said her sister used to keep roomers, but she had quit some time ago, but that she'd talk to her. SOoooooo here we are at 917 Williams Street, El Paso, Texas at the home of Mr and Mrs Malcomb Johnson (about 55 or 60 years old) and they really are grand people. Both Mr and Mrs Johnson work, so there's no one here all day except on Sunday and then we're all here. Well, back to my story. We moved in here the 24th of October. The 25th I started calling the hospitals to see what was open in the line of jobs and ended up by applying at ""Hotel Dieu"". It's a Catholic hospital and I don't know where it got the name. I'm first floor supervisor and the only RN on the floor. Sister Angeline is there part of the time for, oh, I'd say about 1.5 or 2 hours a day. We have 40 patients and the emergency room is also on first floor, and about 25 different doctors to keep track of. I only get $135 a month with 1 meal and laundry, but I'm off at Saturday noon and all day Sunday and Mutt is off at noon Saturday and all day Sunday, too, so that makes it nice. My hours other days are 7:00 to 3:30. I catch a bus two blocks from here at 6:25 AM and get to the hospital at 6:35 AM, but that's the only bus that runs before 7:00 sooooo I have to leave kinda early. Bus fare is 6 cents each way, so that's not bad, either. I like the work, but it's really a rushed place. There are about 6 or 8 students on first floor in the mornings but we have several American-Mexican nurse's aides who are dandies! I'm beginning to pick up a little Spanish, too. No, not much, but a few words here and there. Last Sunday Mutt and I were loafing around here and it was so quiet and the house was stuffy and the Johnsons were gone, and the front yard needed raking quite badly, so we donned old clothes and out we went and cleaned up the yard and it really looks super. (Ahem!!) Anyway, the Johnsons came home and got such a big kick out of it. I didn't go to work this morning because yesterday afternoon Uncle Sam informed Mutt that they were leaving on a plane at 11 PM today for maneuvers in California and that he is to be sergeant of the guard and that he was also to report at 11:00 this morning to be bonded because he is to be responsible for $6200 cash, 10 other GI's, and all the radar equipment that is going out there for it, sooooo Mrs Johnson called the hospital and told them that Mrs Jones was ill today and would not be able to work. That was at 6 AM this morning. Sooooo we went back to sleep and didn't wake up till 8:30. At 8:45 she knocked on the door and said that she had made toast and coffee for us and that there were preserves and fruit juice on the table and she had also written a note and put it in the bathroom just in case we weren't awake when she left at nine. The note read, ""Betty dear, I have fixed the toast and coffee for you two sweet children. You will find cream in the refrigerator. If you want some sweets I put a jar of jam on the table. Hope you enjoy it all by yourselves. Mrs J. Am sure you had rather be alone this morning, than go out to eat."" Wasn't that sweet of her? You see, there are no kitchen privileges with the room, so it was all out of the goodness of her heart. They just came home now and stuck their noses in here and Mr Johnson said, ""Anything we can do for the sick and lonely?"" Mrs Johnson had told him about my being ""sick"" this morning and he got quite a kick out of it. We really had to hustle around here, because my man had his OD's in the tailor shop getting them altered and they were to be ready at noon, so he rushed down there to push them along a little, and I packed his clothes and washed and mended some socks for him. (Had to finish mending one on the way to the field this PM.) He took me to the field with him, but I didn't stay to see the plane take off because he had so many things to attend to anyway. Now he will be gone until about the 25th of November. I hope he's at least back here by December 4, because that's his 27th birthday, and he must have a birthday cake with 27 candles!! Birthdays and Christmas have always meant so much at home, and by golly if I can manage to make it the same in our little family, I'm surely going to try anyway. Johnny and Sandy are sitting over on the dresser looking this way, and I sure do wish they'd just step out of the pictures and toddle over here!! I miss those little monkeys, and wish we could get home to see them before they get too big. Of course, I don't think they'll ever be too big, but if they've grown too much, I won't recognize them. I'll bet Big Boss John has changed a lot, too. Golly, if I keep on here, this old gal will be homesick again, and that would never do, because right now she has no one to tell her troubles to and no one's troubles to hear and that's bad! Can't bother the landlord and landlady with little things like that!! How are the kidless coming with their music lessons?? When are they going to start the Faylet orchestra?? With all that music they ought to be able to do something like that, shouldn't they?? How about that, Pat, Sal, and Mugs?? Sure am glad to hear that Frankie is doing so well in school and hope he keeps it up. Always knew there was something other than sawdust in that noggin of his and I""m glad he found it. Does Fay room with him or do they have separate rooms? Oh yes, and how is Helen now?? I think about her so much with her three little ones and have wondered if she ever started putting some fat on her bones. They really have done wonders with their little family, and hope we can do as well with our family, if we ever have one. So far, no family, but I'd rather not have any while we're bouncing around the country as much as we are. Just think September in California, October and November in Texas, December in South Carolina, and possibly Georgia and then ??? Welllll, it had better be North Dakota for awhile. I hope so anyway. Oh, by the way, by all means give those mitts to Frank. Guess I'll never ever need them again, and there's no use packing them away when they can be used. I got a card addressed to ""Betty Fay Jones"" from the Stennes and Ryan (a wedding congrats) and it was sent to Sib's and Louis' address and they forwarded it on here. Thanks for doing my share at the rummage sale. Doggone it all, I just don't know what I'd do without you, Mom. Here I am clear across the country and still my share of the alumni work is done in North Dakota. Thanks oodles, Mom!! I hope Mrs. Drege gets along okay. She's a pretty heavy lady and it seems that they're always a little slower than a skinny person at recovering from surgery. How's about that, Mom, aren't I right?? (Oh, I'm referring to the skinny people there, Mom!! Ahem!) Well, now it's about time I quit. I'm going to write a special letter to my father tonight. Know the man?? His name is John Fay and he resides in Rugby, North Dakota. Mmmm that's my pop!! Well, one and all, why don't you write to me one of these days again. Yes, I know, you've been doing very well and I've been doing very poorly. Shame on me!! Oh, yes, and will you address them to us at 917 Williams Street, El Paso, Texas. Thanks, and lots and lots and lots of love to you all. Love, Betty. PS Will send a bit of Mutt's love, too, but not too much as ""I need my love to keep me warm"".","Dearest Mom, Pop, and Kidlets.

I started at 10 AM and walked till 4:30 PM and then came home, because I knew my man would be home about 5:00 sooooo the next day I started again, this time at 9 AM, but I got a taxi and the driver was an ex-GI who knew El Paso pretty well, soooooo we stopped here and there and no luck so finally he said, ""I know a lady who has an apartment and she's a good friend of mine and they're very nice people"". Sooooo he drove up to a house, and even went to the door and introduced the lady and I (by the way, her name is Mrs Jones) and we can get her apartment tomorrow if we want it, but I'm not going to take it now. Well, then we stopped and talked to another lady he knew (Mrs Jenkins about 58 or 60 years old) and she said her sister used to keep roomers, but she had quit some time ago, but that she'd talk to her. SOoooooo here we are at 917 Williams Street, El Paso, Texas at the home of Mr and Mrs Malcomb Johnson (about 55 or 60 years old) and they really are grand people. Both Mr and Mrs Johnson work, so there's no one here all day except on Sunday and then we're all here. Well, back to my story. We moved in here the 24th of October. The 25th I started calling the hospitals to see what was open in the line of jobs and ended up by applying at ""Hotel Dieu"". It's a Catholic hospital and I don't know where it got the name. I'm first floor supervisor and the only RN on the floor. Sister Angeline is there part of the time for, oh, I'd say about 1.5 or 2 hours a day. We have 40 patients and the emergency room is also on first floor, and about 25 different doctors to keep track of. I only get $135 a month with 1 meal and laundry, but I'm off at Saturday noon and all day Sunday and Mutt is off at noon Saturday and all day Sunday, too, so that makes it nice. My hours other days are 7:00 to 3:30. I catch a bus two blocks from here at 6:25 AM and get to the hospital at 6:35 AM, but that's the only bus that runs before 7:00 sooooo I have to leave kinda early. Bus fare is 6 cents each way, so that's not bad, either. I like the work, but it's really a rushed place. There are about 6 or 8 students on first floor in the mornings but we have several American-Mexican nurse's aides who are dandies! I'm beginning to pick up a little Spanish, too. No, not much, but a few words here and there. Last Sunday Mutt and I were loafing around here and it was so quiet and the house was stuffy and the Johnsons were gone, and the front yard needed raking quite badly, so we donned old clothes and out we went and cleaned up the yard and it really looks super. (Ahem!!) Anyway, the Johnsons came home and got such a big kick out of it. I didn't go to work this morning because yesterday afternoon Uncle Sam informed Mutt that they were leaving on a plane at 11 PM today for maneuvers in California and that he is to be sergeant of the guard and that he was also to report at 11:00 this morning to be bonded because he is to be responsible for $6200 cash, 10 other GI's, and all the radar equipment that is going out there for it, sooooo Mrs Johnson called the hospital and told them that Mrs Jones was ill today and would not be able to work. That was at 6 AM this morning. Sooooo we went back to sleep and didn't wake up till 8:30. At 8:45 she knocked on the door and said that she had made toast and coffee for us and that there were preserves and fruit juice on the table and she had also written a note and put it in the bathroom just in case we weren't awake when she left at nine. The note read, ""Betty dear, I have fixed the toast and coffee for you two sweet children. You will find cream in the refrigerator. If you want some sweets I put a jar of jam on the table. Hope you enjoy it all by yourselves. Mrs J. Am sure you had rather be alone this morning, than go out to eat."" Wasn't that sweet of her? You see, there are no kitchen privileges with the room, so it was all out of the goodness of her heart. They just came home now and stuck their noses in here and Mr Johnson said, ""Anything we can do for the sick and lonely?"" Mrs Johnson had told him about my being ""sick"" this morning and he got quite a kick out of it. We really had to hustle around here, because my man had his OD's in the tailor shop getting them altered and they were to be ready at noon, so he rushed down there to push them along a little, and I packed his clothes and washed and mended some socks for him. (Had to finish mending one on the way to the field this PM.) He took me to the field with him, but I didn't stay to see the plane take off because he had so many things to attend to anyway. Now he will be gone until about the 25th of November. I hope he's at least back here by December 4, because that's his 27th birthday, and he must have a birthday cake with 27 candles!! Birthdays and Christmas have always meant so much at home, and by golly if I can manage to make it the same in our little family, I'm surely going to try anyway. Johnny and Sandy are sitting over on the dresser looking this way, and I sure do wish they'd just step out of the pictures and toddle over here!! I miss those little monkeys, and wish we could get home to see them before they get too big. Of course, I don't think they'll ever be too big, but if they've grown too much, I won't recognize them. I'll bet Big Boss John has changed a lot, too. Golly, if I keep on here, this old gal will be homesick again, and that would never do, because right now she has no one to tell her troubles to and no one's troubles to hear and that's bad! Can't bother the landlord and landlady with little things like that!! How are the kidless coming with their music lessons?? When are they going to start the Faylet orchestra?? With all that music they ought to be able to do something like that, shouldn't they?? How about that, Pat, Sal, and Mugs?? Sure am glad to hear that Frankie is doing so well in school and hope he keeps it up. Always knew there was something other than sawdust in that noggin of his and I""m glad he found it. Does Fay room with him or do they have separate rooms? Oh yes, and how is Helen now?? I think about her so much with her three little ones and have wondered if she ever started putting some fat on her bones. They really have done wonders with their little family, and hope we can do as well with our family, if we ever have one. So far, no family, but I'd rather not have any while we're bouncing around the country as much as we are. Just think September in California, October and November in Texas, December in South Carolina, and possibly Georgia and then ??? Welllll, it had better be North Dakota for awhile. I hope so anyway. Oh, by the way, by all means give those mitts to Frank. Guess I'll never ever need them again, and there's no use packing them away when they can be used. I got a card addressed to ""Betty Fay Jones"" from the Stennes and Ryan (a wedding congrats) and it was sent to Sib's and Louis' address and they forwarded it on here. Thanks for doing my share at the rummage sale. Doggone it all, I just don't know what I'd do without you, Mom. Here I am clear across the country and still my share of the alumni work is done in North Dakota. Thanks oodles, Mom!! I hope Mrs. Drege gets along okay. She's a pretty heavy lady and it seems that they're always a little slower than a skinny person at recovering from surgery. How's about that, Mom, aren't I right?? (Oh, I'm referring to the skinny people there, Mom!! Ahem!) Well, now it's about time I quit. I'm going to write a special letter to my father tonight. Know the man?? His name is John Fay and he resides in Rugby, North Dakota. Mmmm that's my pop!! Well, one and all, why don't you write to me one of these days again. Yes, I know, you've been doing very well and I've been doing very poorly. Shame on me!! Oh, yes, and will you address them to us at 917 Williams Street, El Paso, Texas. Thanks, and lots and lots and lots of love to you all. PS Will send a bit of Mutt's love, too, but not too much as ""I need my love to keep me warm"".","Love, Betty.

Mutt just brought your ""manuscript"" home, and mmmm was it good!! And that's as far as I got, and that, my dear, was yesterday. It was a beautiful, warm, sunny day and we were sitting out on the porch to absorb some of the sunshine, and we suddenly decided to get some exercise, soooo out to the backyard we went to get a rake to rake the front year, and did we work!!!! Mutt did all the raking. I just swept off the sidewalk, so you see who did the work, don't you?? Twas fun nevertheless, and something to do. But back to your letter. It was wonderful, as usual, and had all the kinds of news I yearn to hear about. Such as where you went, with whom, and who had lunch at home when there was a dance in town, etc, etc, etc. Tis almost like being there, because I can picture everything and everyone. Sure would like to drop in and surprise you at school someday! I imagine you'll be through with this term by the time we get home. We hope to be out about July??? No promises, though! Sounds as if you have been pretty busy with parties. Yes, I know what you mean about that French charm, Fritzie, it can't compare with the Irish!!! Yes, I know Quint. I took care of him as a patient once, if I'm not mistaken, and then I remember that he and I rode home from a dance or something one time with someone else and he got mad at me because I wouldn't let him kiss me. Now, Fritzie, don't tell him that, because you might hurt his feelings. I agree with you that he is a very nice young man, though. I took care of Dad, too, once upon a time. He had a ""plantar's wart"" removed from the ball of his foot when I was in surgery and he darn near kicked Doctor Johnson in the snoot when he was working on his foot. He didn't remember it when he woke up from the anesthetic, but it took more than twice the average dose of Sodium Pentothal to put him to sleep. I'm sure he remembers those hospital days. Sib took care of him then. I was in surgery. Hope Curt finishes his medical course. He's got the stuff in that noggin of his if he just puts it to work. I've been in Upham, so I know just how exciting a place it is. We stopped there to get some rice the day we went to ""Poodle's"" wedding. That was Ruthie, Thelma S, and I and then an Axness boy-drove Daddy's car up there for us. It was raining to beat the cars and we got stuck every time we turned a corner, but got home alright with mud, mud, and more mud all over Daddy's car. Excuse me, but my old man is going to beat up on me if I don't quit pretty soon. He wants to take me to the show and he's standing here saying, ""Come on, Betty"", ""Come on, Betty"", ""Betty!!""  Ahhh I'd better go before he leaves me!! So long for now, more later! 7:30 PM. We're back from the movies. We were going to see ""Blue Skies"" but the line was several blocks long, so we went to see an Alan Ladd picture instead. It was good, too, but I don't remember the name of it. (Tis ""Gang, Inc"" says Mutt!) So Sandy is independent like a certain aunt of hers used to be, is she? Well, now I wonder which aunt that would be?? Oh, yes?? No guessing is necessary in this case. I plead guilty. Say, you know I can't place that Mrs Dixon or Mrs Kirkely but I suppose I would if I saw them again. No doubt they were patients of mine at Good Samaritan Hospital. There is only one hospital here in Sumter and it's pretty well staffed, so I put my name in for private duty for 7 to 3. I put my name in Wednesday afternoon and that night I got a call, so went to work Thursday morning. It was a 62 year old lady who was operated on for a stone in the ureter (the tube connecting the bladder with the kidney) and she really got along super. She had nurses for two days and was feeling so good that we (the other nurse and I) lost our jobs. She was the sweetest little lady and when I left she thanked me for being so good to her and said that if any of her friends got sick she would certainly recommend (you spell it, thanks) me very highly. No, I'm not bragging, but it might come in kind of handy in a strange turn here, just to have a recommendation. Is that big long word spelled right?? Eh headache! Yesterday Mutt went out to the field about 8:30 and I went back to sleep and didn't get up till almost noon. Well, here I was sitting on the bed in my housecoat when my man came home, and at noon at that! Then he started to tease me and he said, ""Gee, I thought you'd have the room all cleaned up when I got home."" I said, ""Gee, I didn't think you'd be home till 3:30 or later."" Soooo he says, ""Well, I'm going to go out on the porch and sit in the sun and pretty soon I'll come in and will pretend I'm just coming home from work and you'll have the room all cleaned."" Soooo he went out on the porch and pretty soon I called him and said he could come home now. Soooo he came home again and the room was all cleaned!!!! The was just before we raked the yard. Right now he's in bed serenading me with harmonica music. He really makes that harmonica hum. Soooo my Fritzie is worried about being almost 22 and still single. Well, Fritzie, take it from one who knows, just wait till you're sure, because by golly, somehow you just know it when it hits you. No, I can't explain it, but you'll know, by golly, when it does. Right now it's ""Brahm's Lullaby"" coming from the harmonica. Tis pretty, too. Mutt has a nice voice, too, so I'm real anxious to get him singing with ""us'n co"". Fritzie, I'm gonna sign off again. Haven't written much of anything, but as yet there's no news. Might be later on, if we get to move into a five room furnished house that we have our eyes on. We should know about it in about a week for sure. (Now it's ""Taps"" from the harmonica.) Must be bedtime. But back to the house. We will even have a telephone of our own so you can call us anytime then. We still hope to make a phone call home, but it won't be till after payday (January 31) now. We'll let you know in advance. That's all for this time and for heavens sakes don't get lost in those snowbanks!!! Till next time, love from us both, Betty and Mutt. PS Telephone just rang. I go to work Tuesday with a Mr Kennedy for surgery. PS Please note, this time I answered soon. Expect same in return. Liz.

I really hit the jackpot yesterday!! Got a letter from Mom and Fritzie and then one of the neighbors came and told me there was a package and a couple letters for me at the little grocery store here near the housing, soooo while I shined my shoes Mutt drove down and got them. Twas the package from home that you sent and birthday cards from Sadie and the folks. Thanks just oodles!! Was especially glad to see those pink articles because something has happened to the elastic in the rest of mine. They used to look like this (drawing) and now they look like this (drawing)!!! Can't figure it out!! The nylons are always welcome! I'll wear them when I can ""dress up"" again. (Gee, won't it be wonderful when I can get into a real dress again??) I didn't try the egg poacher this morning but Azalea (from next door) uses one all the time for little Buddy's vegetables, so I know it will really be a handy little gadget later on. We had real raspberry jam on our toast this morning. Good stuff, too, by golly!! Tasted like fresh raspberries! The dishcloth, I've decided, should be Mutt's to try out first, but so far I haven't convinced him of that. Oh, yes, and baby Jones' little wrapper is so soft! Wish ""it"" would hurry up and get here so I could try some of these things on ""it"". Gonna take that little while dress (trimmed in blue) that you made, Mom, to the hospital with me when I go, because it's just the thing for our wee one to wear home. It will be too hot for anything flannel yet, and probably too hot for a shirt, but we'll see about the shirt when the time comes. I had an X-ray on Thursday and guess what!! I'm gonna have a baby!! The poor little thing is really doubled up in there, but the X-ray shows no evidence of a flat pelvis soooo that's good. It hasn't dropped yet, either, so wouldn't be surprised if I was a week or two late. Anytime is alright with me, though. The sooner the better!! Judging from the x-ray, I'd say that it won't be more than about a 6 pound baby, unless it grows a lot in the next two weeks, and frankly I'd just as soon it stayed around six pounds. I only gained half pound last week, but that was because the doctor had me on a diet. The week before that I gained 3.5 pounds and the previous week 2.5 pounds so if I had kept that up I'd have been pretty big by September 22. I weight 130.75 pounds now, a gain of 18.75 pounds, and I'm not to gain more than 20 so I don't have much to go on. However, I did ""fall off the wagon"" last night and eat one of Margie's brownies she sent, because after all, they were a birthday present and birthdays only come once a year and besides that, they were darn good!! Thanks, Muggsie!! Had a busy day yesterday. Was up at 5:30 so my darling could have breakfast before he left (he has to be at the field at 6:30 now), and then I defrosted my refrigerator, washed dishes, put up the curtains on the windows on the doors (that's all of them up now!), cleaned out some dresser and cupboard drawers, and then by the time I had everything picked up and my bed made and stuff twas time to start dinner. After I had finished the dinner dishes I flopped on the bed for about an hour to rest my big feet. They've been swelling a lot, but it's just due to the cement floors, because I have a urinalysis every week, so I know that's okay. Anyway, I ironed from 2:30 till 5:00. Not that I had so much to iron, but you know my speed!! Mutt had to stand inspection this morning and also a big parade, so I pressed his uniform yesterday and he polished his brass and his shoes and he had a haircut yesterday, so he really looked sharp as a tack this morning. Last night we went to the show to celebrate our first anniversary. It was ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now"" and it was very good. It's in technicolor and is a musical. Hope you get to see it if it comes to Rugby. Just think we've been married a whole year!! And what a wonderful year it has been. I never knew then that it was possible to love anyone as much as I love Mutt or to have anyone mean as much to one as he does to me. A year ago now we were just boarding the bus at Riverside to go to Porterville to see his folks and let me tell you I was one scared chicken!! I was so afraid they wouldn't like me, but I hadn't been there more than a little while before I knew everything was all right. It doesn't seem like it's been a whole year ago, though. But guess I'd better quit reminiscing here. We're going to Sumter (10 miles) today to get our laundry, etc, so suppose I'd better get my mitts on the broom and start sweeping so I'll have that done before noon. Haven't done my dishes as yet, either, and tis 9 bells. Ann was going to try to get an appointment at the beauty shop for me for this afternoon so I can get a feather-cut. This damp weather keeps my hair looking like a bush, so I'm gonna get it cut and it will probably be easier to take care of after our infantees arrives, too. How is Sadie's toe after the last trip to Minot? Hope it's on the mend in time for school too tart. Well, reckon I'd better sign off, but before I do, there's one most important thing to discuss. You asked if we'd have room for you, Mom, if you came to stay with us during the crucial moments!! Boy, we'd find room for the whole family if you wanted to come, even if we had to hang on hooks by turns to keep out of each other's way!!! Never fear!! Anytime any of you want to come and see us, we'll sure find room someplace, so don't worry about that. We've got plenty of bedding, too, and even some extra plates, so you won't have to worry about a thing. Just think!! 16 more days!!! Wheeee! I'm gonna be a mamma and Mutt Boy is gonna be a poppa and Helen is gonna be an aunt and Lester's gonna be an uncle and Johnnie, Sandra, and Jimmy are gonna have a cousin and all for the first time for each of us!!! Gonna quit this nonsense and get to work!! I get started here and could rattle on and on all day to you folks, but gotta get a move on. It's 9:30 now. Thanks again for everything. Oh, almost forgot to thank you for Baby Jones' garters!! Thanks oodles!! Till next time, all our love, Betty, Mutt, and ????? (only one, by golly!!)","Dearest Mom, Pop, and family.

The week before that I gained 3.5 pounds and the previous week 2.5 pounds so if I had kept that up I'd have been pretty big by September 22. I weight 130.75 pounds now, a gain of 18.75 pounds, and I'm not to gain more than 20 so I don't have much to go on. However, I did ""fall off the wagon"" last night and eat one of Margie's brownies she sent, because after all, they were a birthday present and birthdays only come once a year and besides that, they were darn good!! Thanks, Muggsie!! Had a busy day yesterday. Was up at 5:30 so my darling could have breakfast before he left (he has to be at the field at 6:30 now), and then I defrosted my refrigerator, washed dishes, put up the curtains on the windows on the doors (that's all of them up now!), cleaned out some dresser and cupboard drawers, and then by the time I had everything picked up and my bed made and stuff twas time to start dinner. After I had finished the dinner dishes I flopped on the bed for about an hour to rest my big feet. They've been swelling a lot, but it's just due to the cement floors, because I have a urinalysis every week, so I know that's okay. Anyway, I ironed from 2:30 till 5:00. Not that I had so much to iron, but you know my speed!! Mutt had to stand inspection this morning and also a big parade, so I pressed his uniform yesterday and he polished his brass and his shoes and he had a haircut yesterday, so he really looked sharp as a tack this morning. Last night we went to the show to celebrate our first anniversary. It was ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now"" and it was very good. It's in technicolor and is a musical. Hope you get to see it if it comes to Rugby. Just think we've been married a whole year!! And what a wonderful year it has been. I never knew then that it was possible to love anyone as much as I love Mutt or to have anyone mean as much to one as he does to me. A year ago now we were just boarding the bus at Riverside to go to Porterville to see his folks and let me tell you I was one scared chicken!! I was so afraid they wouldn't like me, but I hadn't been there more than a little while before I knew everything was all right. It doesn't seem like it's been a whole year ago, though. But guess I'd better quit reminiscing here. We're going to Sumter (10 miles) today to get our laundry, etc, so suppose I'd better get my mitts on the broom and start sweeping so I'll have that done before noon. Haven't done my dishes as yet, either, and tis 9 bells. Ann was going to try to get an appointment at the beauty shop for me for this afternoon so I can get a feather-cut. This damp weather keeps my hair looking like a bush, so I'm gonna get it cut and it will probably be easier to take care of after our infantees arrives, too. How is Sadie's toe after the last trip to Minot? Hope it's on the mend in time for school too tart. Well, reckon I'd better sign off, but before I do, there's one most important thing to discuss. You asked if we'd have room for you, Mom, if you came to stay with us during the crucial moments!! Boy, we'd find room for the whole family if you wanted to come, even if we had to hang on hooks by turns to keep out of each other's way!!! Never fear!! Anytime any of you want to come and see us, we'll sure find room someplace, so don't worry about that. We've got plenty of bedding, too, and even some extra plates, so you won't have to worry about a thing. Just think!! 16 more days!!! Wheeee! I'm gonna be a mamma and Mutt Boy is gonna be a poppa and Helen is gonna be an aunt and Lester's gonna be an uncle and Johnnie, Sandra, and Jimmy are gonna have a cousin and all for the first time for each of us!!! Gonna quit this nonsense and get to work!! I get started here and could rattle on and on all day to you folks, but gotta get a move on. It's 9:30 now. Thanks again for everything. Oh, almost forgot to thank you for Baby Jones' garters!! Thanks oodles!! ","Till next time, all our love, Betty, Mutt, and ????? (only one, by golly!!)",0.19483392287649884,0.45640571083505876

This is going to be a joint letter because I'd never get separate thank-you written at the rate I'm doing now. First of all, Happy New Year!! It's 8:15 AM and Karen is eating and Daddy has gone to work so all is quiet. Karen had her pablum and formula at 8:00 last night and then slept till 10 minutes to eight this morning, so that's pretty good. I think she's catching cold, though, because she's been coughing and sneezing ever since she woke up this morning. Another 3 weeks and she starts getting her immunization shots. Poor little lamb!! I'll be glad, though, because there's so much whooping cough around here. Now for the Christmas package!! It was wonderful!! Daddy did the honors and opened them (yours and Helen's batch came Saturday a week ago) and Karen and I watched him. She was kinda sleepy and didn't give her pink elephant a second glance, but the next day I tied ribbon across her crib with the elephant on it, and boy does she have a time with it now!! She really wears herself out hitting it and then squealing to beat the cars when it swings back and forth and rattles. We held the bank up for her and she was so sleepy she scarcely saw it, but when Mutt shoot it she was ready to grab it when she heard the noise. The crib spread is beautiful and much too nice to put on her crib right now because we have a coal heater and the whole house is covered in soot. Frank and Pat, Karen says to thank you for her cup and it won't be long before she can use it. The booties came in handy as she has outgrown most of the others, all except for one pair I think. She sure has long feet for such a little squirt. She sure doesn't get that from her Daddy with his 6.5 or 7 shoe!! The hammered trays are lovely! Mutt explained to me just how they're made, as he used to make them when he was in grammar school. We really needed ash trays, too, because we'd broken 3 of them and had just one left, so now with his ""Mutt"" ash tray and the 3 he got from Helen's triplets we're doing pretty good. Daddy, we got a stroller for Karen with the money order you sent. Thanks a million. I propped her up in it Christmas morning for a little while and she had a big time. Her neck is still a wee bit too wobbly to leave her in there very long, but another month she should really make good use of it! I hear someone squealing and can hear the elephant rattle every once in a while, so guess pee-wee Jones is through with her bottle. I took her to the clinic last Monday and she weighs 12 pounds 2 ounces now and is doing fine, he says. I had her all dressed up in the blue dress we gave her for Christmas, the blue shoes she got from Aunt Helen Drege, white anklets, and the blue sweater and cap Mom crocheted for her and boy those blue eyes just looked bluer than ever. Captain Burnette looked at her and she grinned at him so cute and he said, ""My, but she's a pretty baby!"" (Ahem!! Rave on, proud mother, rave on!!!) He said I could start her on vegetables anytime now if she'd take them, but she seems satisfied now with a tablespoonful of pablum twice a day and 6.4 ounces of milk every 4 hours, so I'll wait a little while with the vegetables. Did I tell you that all the apartments got apartment-size ranges for Christmas?? Of course, the government owns them, but are they ever wonderful to cook on compared to the 2-burner hot plates we had. Didn't get it hooked up till December 31, so had fried chicken for Christmas dinner. Twas good anyway. Mutt really likes that travel kit. Guess he's ready to go anytime, now that he's got that to take with him. They really have everything in them, don't they? As to maneuvers, Mutt doesn't have to go on any this time. Sure was glad they called them off before Christmas. Well, thanks for everything and especially the jam preserves and pickles!! Mmmm were they good!! We're not much for pickles but boy!! Those bread and butter pickles are just about gone now and no one but the two of us has been eating them, so that proves how we liked them. Yes, Pat, I can wear those hose. They're so sheer that they don't look too dark. Oh, yes, and the apron is just ""what the doctor ordered"" so to speak. Now let's see, what have I missed??? Well, if I missed anything it's just because I've got a big batch of diapers staring me in the face, so better get at them. Thanks oodles for everything and hope you have a very Happy New Year and the best of everything in 1948. Love from your ""rebels"", the South Carolina Joneses, Betty, Mutt, and Karen.

Billy is kind of a rough little character and bites all the kids in the neighborhood so I have to watch him pretty close, but Kemp sits on the ground beside her stroller and chatters away to her and keeps all the dogs, cats, etc away from her. He's quite the bodyguard. It's nice and cool here today, but goodness only knows what the afternoon will bring. Haven't done anything of importance lately, so guess there's not much news.

Oh, yes, saw Catherine Thomas' name listed in the marriage license applications. Is that George Thomas' oldest girl?? Doesn't seem possible that she is old enough to marry. Who is that Anderson boy she married?? Once again I'll stop. All for now. PS Happy anniversary for June 1949!! There, I'm early with that one!!","Lots of love, Betty, Mutt, and Karen.

Gee, won't be long I can say that, will it, so I'll use it while I can. I just told Karen to sit real still and eat her toast so I could write a note to Pat, so she is sitting here going up and down the scale with ""Pa, Pa, Pa, Pa"" and an occasional ""doot, doot"" with it. I dreamed about you last night. You were a little girl 4 years old dressed in a white dotted Swiss dress and had your hair bobbed short and parted on the left side with a silver barrette on the right side and you were standing up beside a big ironing board ironing. You were the cutest darn thing and had the rosiest cheeks, but I was looking at you and wondering how your head and shoulders could be above that big ironing board, and I'd stoop down to see if your feet were on the floor and they were. Then by the time I got up again, your head and shoulders were still above the ironing board. I asked you how a little girl like you could keep your head and shoulders above the ironing board with your feet still on the floor and all you said was, ""Ask Ada."" Then I woke up! Crazy?? Nope! Just a crazy dream, but it was so real and you were so darned cute! Now for army gossip! Mutt will be going on maneuvers December 15 over by Los Angeles, but will get home weekends. I don't know how long that will last. Oh, yes, and Warrant Officer promotions are put off again till November 26, so they've prolonged that agony another couple weeks. The list was supposed to be out July 15, and they keep delaying it a couple weeks longer all the time, so Mutt is still in ""suspenders."" I know you must be rushing around like mad, getting ready for your wedding day. Mutt says I can go home if I want to, but I know that would mean no Christmas for anybody from us, and it would be quite a trip to make alone with Karen, and besides I'd rather wait till Mutt can go, too, which may mean another year or so. Would really like to be there, but guess you'll have to write and tell me about it. What are your plans? Do you plan to live with Mongers or get an apartment? Where are you going on your honeymoon? Is your wedding going to be formal? Can I get anything here you might need? Oh, I'm so curious I'm just about busting! What are you going to wear for your honeymoon going-away clothes? Want to thank Donnie for the magazine rack. That sure saves a lot of loose papers from cluttering up the place. It's a pretty one, too. Karen's rocking chair isn't here, yet, but the papers with the magazine rack said the other papers would be with the rest of our order, so it should be here any day now. We're going to go over to the Launderette on the base at noon today to do our laundry, so we're having chili for dinner. They've got 10 machines over there, so I shouldn't have any trouble getting a few of them. Still haven't finished the ironing I had when you were here, but have the bathroom curtains up and also the flowered curtain over the shelves and the shelves straightened up so the bathroom looks real nice. Gotta start on Fibber McGee's closet again but will wait till after I get Christmas stuff out of the way. I called Sib yesterday and she said Louis is back with Duane. She said there was more to the story than that, but that she'd tell me when she saw me. Laura Thompson (last name now?) was over to see Sib and is expecting her first baby in three weeks. She married her boss about 4 years ago and he was a widower with a son about 5 or 6 years old then. We're going over to see her someday. She lives in San Bernardino just 4 blocks from the bus depot, so we know where to find her now. Well, Pat, I know you're busy and I'm just rattling on anyway, so I'll quit.

Your letter about Uncle Bern got here day before yesterday via Porterville, but have not sent a card for fear he wouldn't be there to get it. I figured he would have had surgery by now because it took the letter so long to get here and hated to send a card not knowing what the outcome was. I'm going to call Uncle Gus this afternoon (if I can locate him) and see if he has heard. I've had Karen't coat and cap at the cleaners and we've been having sand storms, so couldn't get to a phone to call him. It looks clear today, though, so will go up and call him as soon as Mutt gets home from inspection and parade, which should be before noon. Uncle Gus won't be in his office after noon and I don't know his new address so will have to catch him before he leaves the office. Sure hope Uncle Bern makes the grade. What is Mrs Mitzel's trouble? Mutt brought Karen't rocking chair home with him when he came for supper last night and you should have seen her! I had started to feed her and when she saw the rocking chair she went back and forth in her high chair and kept saying, ""Wa-bye, wa-bye"" and then wanted to get right in it, so we put her in it and she just more than ""wa-byed"". It's a wicker rocker painted cream with the edges dark brown and has a bright-flowered upholstered seat. Matter of fact, she's in it again now with her baby and her pillow. Hasn't even gotten her clothes on yet, and could scarcely take time to eat any breakfast. Maybe she will get hungry again after the first novelty of it all wears off. Had the nicest surprise night before last!! It was 8:30 and I had just taken Karen't coveralls off and put dry pants on her to put her to bed, when there was a knock at the door. I knew it wasn't Mutt at that time of the night, so opened the inside door and looked through the screen and lo and behold!! There stood Sib, Louis, and Louis Gene, Jay Kirkeide, and Palmer Johnson! Boy, it was good to see somebody from home and so nice of them to bother to look us up. I really did appreciate it. Course as things always, happen, I had just taken the garbage out just before they came and it was windy, so my hair was standing on end, Karen just had her shirt, diapers, anklets, and socks on, I'd washed clothes and had them on the davenport, had done some ironing while supper cooked so the ironing board was still up; had washed the sheet and towel that I use to cover the footlockers I use for a radio stand, so those ugly green things stuck out like sore toes. I had the rest of the house all clean, dishes washed, floors clean, and Karen't toys picked up, so that helped some. We had a good time chatting anyway and I forgot what I looked like or what my living room looked like and just enjoyed our visit amidst it all. I had baked a cake the day before and it had kind of dried out, but they ate it anyway. Mutt teased me about it and said that those fellows would probably go back to North Dakota and tell folks that they sure felt sorry for Mutt Jones to have to eat cake like that. Crazy kid!! It was the night for monthly inventory at the Px, so Mutt was a little late getting home. When they take inventory for the army it's really inventory!! Have to even list their cigarettes by the number of cigarettes, not by the number of packs or cartons, and an officer has to check with them. I picked a bouquet of cosmos out of our yard yesterday. Can you do that in North Dakota now. I was telling Jay that Grandma Jones had such beautiful roses in bloom in their front yard now and he laughed and said that he and Palmer picked a couple white roses in Long Beach, too. Judging from the way he laughed, I'd say that they were probably two-legged roses! Well, I've got to get dressed and get at the house so it won't look too rough when ""Papa Comes Marching Home Again, Hurrah, Hurrah"". Can just imagine the way everybody is rushing around there now with everything going on. Oh, by the way, Pat, Dad Jones said to tell you, you should have set your wedding for December 2 because that's his birthday and that's a good, good day. By golly, Mutt's is the 4th, too. Karen and I have been putting pennies, nickels, and dimes in her bank so we'd have something to surprise her Daddy with, don't know what it will be yet. Gotta quit again.

Just finished my ironing so will take a few minutes off (and a few pounds off my feet) and write you a line to give you the latest dope. Went to the doctor Monday and I now tip the scale at 129.75 pounds, a gain of 25 pounds, 5 since you left. Everything I eat puts on a pound or two and believe me I feel it now. My poor abdomen is stretched till it's got purple streaks on it and my darned kids won't let me sit, lie, or even stand comfortably now. Heaven help me if I put on any more weight because I have to turn sideways now to reach the bottom of the kitchen sink to wash dishes!! Frank would sure snort if he saw me now! Had a funny spell last weekend, but don't know what it was. It started about noon Saturday and I had blurred vision, ringing in my ears, and dizzy as a loon, but not so bad that I couldn't get around. Sunday morning it was worse and every time I'd start to get up, everything would spin and go black, so I spent all day in bed. Monday morning I was still rather lit, but able to stand up and walk without staggering, so kept my appointment at the clinic. My blood pressure and urinalysis were okay and the doctor said it was just from pressure on nerves because of the twins and the only thing to do was to rest as much as possible and stay out of crowds, off buses, etc and not to go anyplace alone soooo that was that. I was down most of Monday afternoon, but got up and washed clothes Tuesday and ironed today and still feel pretty pert. Thought we were going into the production business early this morning because I had some pretty good back pains and low abdominal pains from about 1:30 or 2:00 AM till 6 AM, but they quit entirely again, and haven't even had a twinge since, so guess it was all a false alarm. The doctor at the hospital says ""they"" will arrive about the 1st of April, so still have a couple weeks to go. We're still looking for names, so if you have any suggestions, send them along One girl will be Frances Maudeen and another one might happen along, so how about a suggestion. Also have Rodney LeRoy for the boy, but might need another boy's name. We're stumped as to names, so ask Uncle Leo and Aunt Helen, maybe they can help us out if you can't. Oh, forgot to tell you, Daddy, that when the Joneses were going back to Porterville from Cayucos they had trouble with the jeep, so stopped to get it fixed and while they were there, old Dad Stemper fell into a grease pit and came out grease from head to foot. Didn't get hurt, but it tickled him and Dad Jones both after that fall in Cayucos, too. Those two sure are a team, aren't they? Called Dorothy Beck Byergo the other day (last week) and we talked for about half an hour or so and she called me yesterday and we gabbed some more. I wrote to Sib and asked them to come down this weekend and also asked her to call Laura Thompson and see if she could come Sunday and Dorothy and her husband are coming over, so we can really have a gay time if we all get together. I saw Laura in 1945 but haven't seen Dorothy since 1940 and she hasn't seen either Sib or Laura since 1939, so we'll have a lot to talk about. Dorothy is expecting the 1st of May, so we're in the same boat. Got your letter from Grammie's and was so glad to hear that she is feeling so good. I remember little ""Jo-Mo"". Gee, he's about 5 years old now. Donahey left on emergency furlough last Thursday because his mother was ill, but she passed away Friday and he didn't get home there till Monday afternoon. She had 6 or 7 spells before and has been unable to talk since 1946, and the doctor said if she had come out of this one she would have been blind, too. She was 65 years old. The boys in the squadron took up a collection for a wreath for her funeral and they wired that as soon as they got the address. Irene and Dayle Junior didn't go because he was flying on government planes and only GIs can catch hops like that. Rumors of transfer to Orlando Field, Florida by April 1 are red hot now. We aren't worried, though, because they can't move Mutt anyway for a while. Colonel Emory was making a list of the men here whose wives were pregnant and beside Jones' name he put a big two. One of the girls upstairs here is about 4 months pregnant, so I guess we'll both be staying here. They won't send the whole squadron anyway, just a cadre of men. Mutt went to look at the quarters that were being vacated at the field and guess it was a beauty!! The wallpaper was pulling off in strips and it was absolutely overrun with cockroaches. It was on such a steep hill that you couldn't get up and down it without a car, and there was no paint on the outside of the building at all, so he just told them ""No, thanks, we'd stay where we were awhile"". Well, tis 5:25 now and time to start supper for Miss Karen. We're having liver tonight, so guess I'll have liver and lettuce. Good, huh?? Karen has to have her potatoes and vegetables, though so she can get as fat as Mommie. Say, Mom, you said Daddy had been doing most of the letter writing. Where's he sending them all?? Tell him to get mixed up and send one this way. Our address is still 2980 Rosecrans Street, and I don't think we've gotten our two letters from him yet this year!!

Called Dorothy Beck Byergo the other day (last week) and we talked for about half an hour or so and she called me yesterday and we gabbed some more. I wrote to Sib and asked them to come down this weekend and also asked her to call Laura Thompson and see if she could come Sunday and Dorothy and her husband are coming over, so we can really have a gay time if we all get together. I saw Laura in 1945 but haven't seen Dorothy since 1940 and she hasn't seen either Sib or Laura since 1939, so we'll have a lot to talk about. Dorothy is expecting the 1st of May, so we're in the same boat. Got your letter from Grammie's and was so glad to hear that she is feeling so good. I remember little ""Jo-Mo"". Gee, he's about 5 years old now. Donahey left on emergency furlough last Thursday because his mother was ill, but she passed away Friday and he didn't get home there till Monday afternoon. She had 6 or 7 spells before and has been unable to talk since 1946, and the doctor said if she had come out of this one she would have been blind, too. She was 65 years old. The boys in the squadron took up a collection for a wreath for her funeral and they wired that as soon as they got the address. Irene and Dayle Junior didn't go because he was flying on government planes and only GIs can catch hops like that. Rumors of transfer to Orlando Field, Florida by April 1 are red hot now. We aren't worried, though, because they can't move Mutt anyway for a while. Colonel Emory was making a list of the men here whose wives were pregnant and beside Jones' name he put a big two. One of the girls upstairs here is about 4 months pregnant, so I guess we'll both be staying here. They won't send the whole squadron anyway, just a cadre of men. Mutt went to look at the quarters that were being vacated at the field and guess it was a beauty!! The wallpaper was pulling off in strips and it was absolutely overrun with cockroaches. It was on such a steep hill that you couldn't get up and down it without a car, and there was no paint on the outside of the building at all, so he just told them ""No, thanks, we'd stay where we were awhile"". Well, tis 5:25 now and time to start supper for Miss Karen. We're having liver tonight, so guess I'll have liver and lettuce. Good, huh?? Karen has to have her potatoes and vegetables, though so she can get as fat as Mommie. Say, Mom, you said Daddy had been doing most of the letter writing. Where's he sending them all?? Tell him to get mixed up and send one this way. Our address is still 2980 Rosecrans Street, and I don't think we've gotten our two letters from him yet this year!! Our love to Aunt Helen and Uncle Leo. Is big bud home now?? PS Karen's hollering, ""Mommy. Eats.""","Love, Betty, Mutt, and menagerie. ",0.0918780193236715,0.4487117552334944

Both have dark hair, noses like their Daddy's, and light eyebrows and eyelashes like their mamma. Hmm, maybe they'll be redheads someday. I'd have sworn that one of them had a wrinkled forehead like yours and mine, the first time I saw him, but they haven't cried enough for me to see any wrinkles since then, so don't know if the wrinkles are still there or not. I don't believe Grandma has gotten to see the cherubs yet, because they won't show them to anyone except the father and he can only see them once, so that's rough. Oh, well, wait'll I get them home then Grandma can spoil one and that proud papa can spoil the other one. Am so anxious to see how Karen reacts to them. I feel pretty chipper these days. Was in bed till Sunday morning and then got up, took a shower, walked to the nursery and got one son to feed and then get up and down as I please, so that's not so bad for 24 hours after having twins, is it?

We got in here about 5:30 PM yesterday in pitch darkness. It had been dark then for a couple hours. Gets light about 7:30 AM. Now for our trip. Will start with our departure from the hostess house or thereabouts. Tried to call Uncle Leo's all day Monday and Tuesday and couldn't get them but finally got a hold of them on Wednesday, November 9 AM and they came to see us that PM. They're both looking good but still seem kinda jittery after the accident. We had a real nice visit with them. Tuesday, November 8 nite Lorraine and Dan and Kellen and their two came to see us. Danny Kay is the image of his daddy and kinda chubby. Bonnie is small and a very pretty little girl with big blue eyes and long blonde curls. Lorraine and Dan both look fine. Dan works with oil heaters installing and repairing about the same work as Bill Ronig does, I believe. Didn't see Mrs Elmer Johnson, but Lorraine said that she still feels fine out here and has never had any more of those spells. She says her dad has aged a lot. Eugene Keller is in Kodiak, Alaska, in the Navy Air Force but don't know just where that is from here. Sergeant and Mrs. Potts and family were up to see us Tuesday night, too. They're stationed just a few miles from here. (From Seattle that is.) Now for our departure. We had to leave all our luggage tags and outside our door at 6:30 AM Thursday November 10. Then we all met in the lobby of the hostess house at 8:30 and government buses took us to the ship. As we got off the bus there were Filipino stewards from the ship standing there to carry all the babies aboard ship and help you locate your state room. Dependents all travel first class. We had two lower and two upper bunks and a davenport which made into a bed. Our room had five clothes closets, private bathroom with shower, toilet and wash bowl. Naturally this being my first experience on the ship, I was all eyes. The thing that struck me the funniest was the slant of the floor. They aren't built level but on a decided slant with the higher level towards the center of the boat. There was lots of drawer space, one big chest of drawers with seven drawers and three drawers under each of the two lower bunks and the davenport. The sendoff we got was very impressive, I thought. Almost everyone was up on deck and the army band played as we were towed out of port. Don't remember what the first songs were, but the last was Auld Lang Syne, and the one before that was ""Now Is The Hour"". Gave me kind of a funny feeling to look out at all that endless expanse of water, which seemed to lead to nowhere, but we got here, so guess it led somewhere! As soon as the boat got underway we went back to our rooms and our room steward came with life preservers. Then there were a series of whistle toots and everybody donned their life preservers and proceeded up to B deck (we were down on C) to their designated boat station for fire drill. It's just a practice drill so that everyone will know where to go in case of emergency and so that people won't all clutter to one life boat. We had two drills, one the second day out. When we came onboard ship we were given a card so we know when to go to meals and which place at what table was yours. You kept the same place every meal. There was a nursery, too, where you took all babies that didn't eat regular meals. They had plenty of cribs, and high chairs and the mothers brought their babies in there 15 minutes before meal time and could feed them before they themselves went to eat. Your bottles were washed and formula made every day for you and there was baby food warmed up and ready to feed the babies when you went in the nursery. We were just two doors from the nursery and right next-door to the hospital. Also right across the aisle from the passenger laundry. Down the hall a ways was a children's playroom, complete with tables, chairs, lots of black boards, drinking fountain, toys, and a children's bathroom off of that. Dining room was at the end of the hall and talk about food!! Anything and everything you wanted. The last evening at sea is the captains dinner. Everyone spruces up a bit and the dining room is all decorated with streamers, balloons, etc. Beside each plate is a paper hat and a special menu with a picture of the Frederick Funston and the names of his crew. Those we got out to keep for souvenirs. That is also the time everyone tips their dining room steward. There was a library and several lounges up on the deck. Also a theater but yours truly didn't get much chance to frequent any",Good morning!,"Here we are at last in the wild and wintry northland! We got in here about 5:30 PM yesterday in pitch darkness.

Dining room was at the end of the hall and talk about food!! Anything and everything you wanted. The last evening at sea is the captains dinner. Everyone spruces up a bit and the dining room is all decorated with streamers, balloons, etc. Beside each plate is a paper hat and a special menu with a picture of the Frederick Funston and the names of his crew. Those we got out to keep for souvenirs. That is also the time everyone tips their dining room steward. There was a library and several lounges up on the deck. Also a theater but yours truly didn't get much chance to frequent any",,0.12496780473195564,0.37539417605455344

He may have had to fly to Cole Bay today, he wasn't sure. Got some pictures so will send them all home and maybe everyone will get to see them eventually. Sent one set to the Joneses, too. January 11, 7:30 AM. Gonna get this off or bust!! Gonna go house hunting today, so had to stay up this morning. I've been going back to bed till 9 or 10 AM because the kids won't sleep unless all the lights are out and it's such a small apartment that every light shines on them. The little devils won't go to sleep till we do at night and are up at six when the alarm goes off and only sleep about an hour, once in awhile two, during the day and I know it isn't enough sleep for them. Have an appointment at the hospital Monday morning at nine to have them circumcised. Richard caught cold yesterday so may not be able to be fixed up, but am going to steam him good and maybe it will break before then. Richard has three upper teeth now and poor little Rodney doesn't have any. He has four uppers ready to pop and he's been pretty fussy so maybe they'll come through pretty soon. They both pull up on the sides of the crib and stand there. Richard has been one jump ahead of Rodney all the time, but holy smokes has Rodney speeded up lately! He's quick as lightning and so wiry. Almost have to hog-tie him to get diapers on him. You should see those two fight! They pull hair, slap, and crawl all over each other. It's getting to be a common occurrence to hear one yelling and find the other one sitting on the squealing brother's full stomach. They say ""Dada"" all day long and when you try to get them to say ""Mama"" they squeal ""Dada dada dada"" just as loud and indignant as can be. Such boys! Getting sweeter every day. Had them on the floor the other day and fist thing I knew Karen was yelling bloody murder! Richard took her pillow away from her and was on his stomach hanging onto the pillow for dear life and the biggest devilish grin on his face. She's really going to catch the dickens from him when they get a little older. Every time she gets close to the crib he grabs a handful of her hair and stands there holding tight, with that Jimmy Drege grin, while Karen yells for help. Ahhhh, never a dull moment!! Rodney is just as active now, I believe, but doesn't look for the devilment that Richard does. Not yet, anyway. What's happened to you people back there?? Is Mom sick or something?? Haven't had a letter from her since before Christmas which is pretty unusual for her! I owe Pat a letter and Fritzie, too. Haven't written a thank-you letter to Lil and Frank yet. Gee, only six more days before they become a family of 3, or four?? Karen has enjoyed her crayons so much. Fritzie says that Bruce has named their daughter-to-be ""Jennifer Jean"". I think that's real cute. Don't know if I'll have a husband or not tonight. He may have to fly to Barter Island today. Our household goods got here yesterday and have to be delivered by the 16th, so that's why we're looking for a bigger place. Only two in sight so far. Each have two bedrooms. One is $75 a month plus utilities, unfurnished, and no bathroom or water but a pump outside the door. The other is $150 a month plus utilities furnished but has bath and water. Gonna look at the furnished one today and check on furniture prices for the other one. Then on Saturday, Mutt and I are going to see the unfurnished one. Mutt is supposed to get paid today. They've got his pay all mixed up. Should have drawn $404 on payday and all he got was $91 and was he mad!! Don't blame him, because a $300 difference is pretty rough. He went over to the finance office yesterday and guess it's all straightened out pretty well now, so we'll come out alright next month. Was Santa Claus good to you people? He sure was good to us. Too good, I think. Can't find room for everything here. Wait till we get our bigger place, though. We'll get lost in two bedrooms, living room, and kitchen. There's been an intestinal flu going around. Rounswall has been home for four or five days with it. Karen had a touch of it, and guess that's what I had, too. Anyway, everybody is on the mend now, thank goodness! Gotta get the Dec 29 Collier's today and read all about the 10th Rescue Squadron. There are three series of it. The Commanding Officer, Colonel Bernt Balchen, has really made the squadron famous up here. You can find an article about it almost every paper you pick up here. Well, hope nothing is wrong at home. Hope it's just that you're busy. Have been kind of worried because haven't heard from either Helen or Mom, so had a feeling something was wrong at home. Toodle-oo for this time and lots of love from us all, Betty, Mutt, and family of wee ones.","Greetings, everybody. ","6:10 PM and no papa yet.

Well, this is the third letter I've started to you and maybe I'll finish this one. Mutt plans on calling you from Colorado Springs either tomorrow or the next day, so this will all be old news to you by then. We had planned on surprising you about August 7, but by the sounds of things guess we won't wait that long. Seems like I'm following Helen's pattern. Started losing water over a week ago and guess I lost most of it, so they plunked me in here a week ago today and both Captain Guest and Colonel Saxer (he's a friend of Uncle Gus') say I won't carry it through and that I will definitely have a miscarriage before I get out of here. I feel wonderful, though. No aches, no pains, not flowing a speck but am kept flat in bed all the time. I still have hopes of carrying it through if something doesn't happen pretty soon. They say I'll stay right where I am till something does happen. Come and see me in July. I'll probably still be here. Rachel and Bud and the boys moved in to take care of the boys and Karen for what I thought would be two or three days and are still there. Don't know if they'll stay till I get out or not. It's quite a load to drop on them all at once and Rachel hasn't been feeling too well, either. She has thyroid trouble and also some other female trouble, so don't know if she can take it all or not. It didn't help matters any that Mutt had to go to the states right now, either, but there was no alternative. They had to have a radar operator and he's the only one on the base right now, so there were no ands, ifs, or buts about it. They took General Frank Armstrong, General Twining, and Colonel Balchen to Camp Carson for a conference and plan to be back here about the 21st or 22nd so it won't be too long. We debated and debated about whether to tell you about our situation here right now for fear you'd worry, but Mutt couldn't call you from Colorado and tell you everything was fine when it wasn't so finally decided the truth was the best way. Now you know. How are the rest of your pregnant family? Looks like 1950 is production year for the Fays, doesn't it? Mutt brought the Tribune up here Saturday and I had the laugh of my life!! For heaven's sake, tell Frank Hornstein the ""bears"" don't get that close to us that they might open the door and run off with one of our children. The only Bear Bruin I've seen was a mighty dead one sticking out the trunk of some lucky hunter's car. I wouldn't have wanted to exactly shake hands with the old fellow dead or alive anyway because he looked pretty gruesome even if he was dead! Sure did get a kick out of the article, anyway. Never miss reading his column because that's what makes the paper, but was sure surprised to pick up the paper and read about the Joneses in it. Well, Mom, tomorrow you greet your fifties, don't you? Gee, I landed in here so fast I didn't even get a card off to you, but will wish you a happy birthday, anyway, and will be thinking of you puffing hard enough to blow out that added candle. Mutt was a pretty worried man when he left here last night wondering what to do and what plans to make for the kids for the next couple months and wondering what would happen here while he was gone and a dozen other things. Rachel was just here and looks very much alive. Glad to see she's surviving it all. She says she's getting along fine with the kids and she didn't look like she had turned gray haired yet, so guess she will make it. March 14, 1950. Happy birthday, Mom!! Went to sleep last night and didn't finish this so will add some more. It's 8 AM. Have had breakfast, my bath, my penicillin shot, etc so am all set for another day. Guess I'd better finish ""Becca's booties"" today and get them off to her before she gets too big for them. I have finished one bootie and both the thumbless mittens for her and am almost through with the other bootie. Tell Frank that the booties have been examined by a General's wife and they were pronounced ""darling, quaint, and beautiful"" so no doubt after wearing them Becca will be the world's First Lady general, ""General Rebecca Fay"", in about 1980 or 1990, that is! Mrs. Twining has been in here about a month, but gets a hospital pass to go home weekends. She has a ""trick"" knee (one that snaps out of joint without warning) and is in the wheelchair a good share of the time. She's a very good patient and expects no special favors or attention which some of the ""brass"" demand. Guess I'll quit for now. Send any mail to the squadron address as I don't know how long I'll be here or if they will deliver mail here at the hospital. Don't worry about stuff and things here. I'm not. Figure old Mother Nature knows what she's doing one way or another and whatever happens or doesn't happen will no doubt be for the best.

Richard just had another penicillin shot and is trying hard to go to sleep, so I'll tell you our latest troubles! Yes, we're in the hospital again. This time it's Richard with tracheobronchitis. He got sick Saturday. Took his temperature Saturday evening and it was 104.6 degrees. Took him to the dispensary and saw the pediatrician. All he could find wrong was a little tonsillitis so gave him a shot of penicillin and we took him home again. Sunday morning his temperature was 103.6 degrees at 10:30 AM and by 4:30 PM was 105 degrees. I gave him cool enemas, aspirin, and alcohol sponge baths and his temperature just wouldn't give an inch. Took him back to the dispensary and he got another shot of penicillin. Took him home and Mutt and I took turns bathing him with the alcohol and his temperature hit 105.6 degrees. Finally got it down to 104.6 degrees and Mutt covered him up good and rocked him and he finally started to perspire. Worked with him till 11 PM and it finally went down to 102.4 degrees, so put him in Karen's bed and I slept with him and Karen crawled in with her Daddy. Monday morning his temperature was 99.8 degrees at 9:30 AM. At 12:30 PM it was 103.6 degrees, at 1:15 PM it was 104 degrees so took him to the dispensary. Took a chest x-ray and his chest is clear. Captain Guinn gave me a syringe and needles and some penicillin so I could give him shots every three hours at home. By 5 PM his temperature was 105.4 degrees again after having two cooling enemas, sponge baths for an hour and aspirin, so we called Captain Guinn and he said to bring him out here right away. His temperature was 99.8 degrees this morning and at noon, but he is so listless. He just seems completely worn out and when he sits up his eyes get so hazy and he looks like it's all he can do to sit there. It will probably be awhile before he gets back on the right track after running such a high fever so continually for that long a time. Now here's the latest. Captain Guinn says we should get these babies out of Alaska, because he doesn't think they're going to be well till we do and he feels we definitely shouldn't spend another winter up here with them. He is writing a letter recommending an emergency medical return to the states for us and Mutt is to pick up the letter today. We will very, very likely be back in the states next month. It all depends on whether they will risk flying me back now that I've hit the 7 month mark, or will tomorrow. Rather risky to take off at 8 months and that's what I'll be by the time orders are cut on the situation, but we've got to get these babies out of here. They can't take many more sieges like they've been having and still make the grade. Mutt will be transferred someplace in the states but don't have any idea yet just where it might be. We haven't decided definitely whether to go to California or North Dakota. Would you have room for us for awhile????? I hate to move in on anyone with three kids and expecting another one, but we'll have to got wherever Mutt is stationed just as soon as I can travel again. He's been going in circles trying to figure out what to do, particularly on such short notice. He was supposed to fly out to the chain again tomorrow for several days on top of all this, but was going to try to get out of it today. They've got us ion the isolation ward and no visitors are allowed and we're not allowed out of our rooms till we're dismissed so I don't know what the score in the ""outside world"" is. Don't even know if Rodney and Karen are with Rachel, or with Grace Anderson, or just where they are. I'm sure they'll be taken care of anyway. They were both feeling good. Rodney was awfully mad at his mama at times the past few days because Richard was getting so much attention and all Rodney got was bathed, fed, and dry pants. Poor little lamb! Suppose Fritzie and Bruce are there now. Won't be much longer for them, will it? What are they going to name their boy? And what are Pat and Don gonna name their kids??? Heh, heh, all half dozen of them!! Running out of paper. Gonna have to use the other side, too. Got the picture of Fritzie and decided she must be pregnant or something. She doesn't look very big for being about ready to pop. I wrote a letter to Martha Cats, so she will know where I'm at now. Mom, it wasn't Martha you send the package to. That was Ann Fulton. I explained to Martha that you mistook her for Ann and to disregard the part in your letter about the package because you didn't send her any. Martha is from Georgia and was in South Carolina with us the same time Fultons were. I haven't heard from Ann since I got up here, but I'm gonna drop her a line and see if I can track her down. They were in Great Bend, New York the last I heard and were waiting for European orders, so maybe they're in Europe someplace now. Pew!! Think Richard just filled his pants. He sure do stink anyway. Can't tell. Might see you soon. Will let you know as soon as we hear anything definite one way or the other. Love from me and my boy here, and Pa and his kids at home.

Haven't much good news for you this time. Went to see Doctor Fox yesterday and the baby is turned wrong again and the head is up by my ribs. It was pretty discouraging news, but nothing can be done about it now, as it's too late in the game to try to turn it. It won't make any difference except that I'll probably go till the 15th of August. Pleasant thought, isn't it? I had hoped we could be back together by then, but it looks like it will be longer than we had figured on. I asked him how soon I could travel and he said if the baby should turn around, which he doesn't think will happen, then I could go in about two weeks after the delivery. If the baby comes breech, then I'll have more stitches and wouldn't be able to travel for at least three weeks or more, so that'll probably make it September before I get out of here. As for a diaphragm they're almost 100% foolproof. Says as long as we used it right we wouldn't have to worry about increasing our family any more. Everything else is fine. Blood getting up to par gradually and urine is okay. Blood pressure and everything else is okay, too. So much for that. Stopped at the bank and got our bank statement. Also cashed and deposited Chacon's check. Our bank balance at present is $181.88. That's what it will read when all the checks get in, anyway. Paid $30 on the grocery bill this month. Pop's bill was $106 at Bickler's this month, but Mom has been canning so that included 100 pounds of sugar ($10), 1 crate of peaches and cherries, and then Catherine and Buzz and 2 kids were here for a couple days, too, so that made the bill bigger. Helen was at the clinic yesterday, too, and guess what ails her!! Yep, she's pregnant again. Her blood is up good this time and Doctor C.G. Johnson said there was no reason why she shouldn't carry this one through. She's due March 25 and are they excited. Sure hope she goes through okay this time. She feels fine and weighs 102 pounds now, which is more than she has weighed for several years, so she's got a good chance of making a go of it this time. Now I know what to do with my maternity clothes when I leave, too. Honey, disregard that letter I wrote the other day about changing our ""girls"" name. I was kinda down in the dumps that day and so cross I had to watch myself all day to keep from biting somebody's head off and every time I said something about ""Frances"" I'd have to explain ""Frances Maudeen"" and it just got my goat. Just one of those nerve wracking pregnant days when everything upsets me. I've had quite a few of them the last few days, but think it's just the impatience of waiting to get it over with, everyday hoping this is the day and then nothing happens. I miss you so darn much, too, and when day after day goes by I'm still sitting here waiting for action I know it will be just that much longer before I can see you again. Gruesome thoughts, aren't they? I've been crocheting a bonnet to go with the sweater and booties so should finish that any day now. I've forgotten to get belly binders for the twerp, but am just going to cut a few out of flannel instead of buying them. How was the ball game?? Am so glad you went, because you need something to look at besides barracks walls once in a while. I don't worry about you spending your time at the bar, Honey, because I have lots of faith in your will power to stay away from there now, and it's such a relief not to have that worry. It's been a year now, and what a wonderful year!! Just took time out to check on our little family. The babies are in the playpen happy as larks and Karen is digging dirt and singing away. She sure misses you. I hear, ""Is our baby at the hospital yet, so my Daddy can come home?"". That is asked at least once a day and sometimes six or seven times. Think she's given up hope that it's ever going to get here. Yippee!! Sadie just brought me a letter from T/Sgt. Francis Jones. Know him! Egads. What scandal!! What in the world ever hit the 606th that it got that rough? Can just see that Joe telling the officers off. Bet that was a one man side show in itself, cuz he was strictly a character. Couldn't help but like him even if I did blame him for some of the sprees you two had, but Joe's a good egg, anyway. Wonder if they didn't adopt a war orphan, seeing the birth announcement come from Germany. Well, it's 6:30 PM now. Guess I'd better get on the beam. We washed clothes this morning and they're ready to be brought in, Mom's cleaning the basement, Margie just came back from the clinic after having her ears cleaned out and she can hear again, Sadie just got home from work, Pop just came from downstairs, and the kids are in the house, so no use trying to write any more.

Suppose Mom is in Biloxi, so won't include her in this letter. We got here day before yesterday and got this house yesterday. It's a lovely place. The outside doesn't look so nice, but the inside is very nice and the cleanest place we've ever moved into. We have a living room as big or bigger than Pat's and Don's whole apartment, two big bedrooms, a bath, hallway, and big kitchen about the size of your living room. It's nicely furnished with new bedroom suites, big Monkeyward refrigerators, big gas stove, built-in sink and cupboards and regular dining room table and chair set in the kitchen. There is linoleum in the bathroom and kitchen but the other floors are bare. It has furnace heat with thermostat control, but it's too warm for any heat yet. We pay $90, landlord pays all utilities except a phone. There's a phone here so we can get incoming calls, but can call out on it, till we've contacted the phone company and paid a deposit on that. There was a long list of rentals in the paper and almost all rent listed at $125 for 2 bedroom places, so guess we were lucky to get this for $90. That still seems pretty steep, buttttt such is life. The climate is ideal. Warm, but a little breeze with it. The kids have finally taken off their undershirts and even went barefoot for awhile. We stopped in Gravette, Arkansas and saw Mutt's mother and dad. They had gotten there Sunday and we got there Monday forenoon. Sure surprised them. We left there Thursday PM and got in here Friday AM, about 2:00. Drove straight through cuz it was too blamed hot to travel much during the day. We stopped in Oakie City a couple hours or so and looked up one of Mutt's crew members (the pilot) that he flew with overseas.

Too bad they didn't have more time, because I think they could out-gab Ruthie and I and that's saying quite a bit. Ho ho ho! Mutt just came in and is he a sight! He's been out in the yard without a shirt on and his back is the prettiest red you ever saw! Thought at his age he'd know better. The lawn looks pretty nice, though. How is little Donita? I hear she's a bottle baby now, too. Mark has had colic yesterday and today, so suppose it's due to change of water again. He's lying on his tummy on a hot water bottle so is pretty peaceful again. He's sure been a good baby, thank heavens! How is Helen making the grade? Sure hope everything goes okay with her this time. I've got the oven heating so I can bake a cake, so better get it in the oven. Then it will be time to get supper started. Haven't got much stuff unpacked yet, but that won't take too long. We've got two clothes closets and imagine we can put 6 or 8 footlockers in them when our stuff gets here.

Mutt just went to work, twins are sleeping, Mark in the car bed playing with the exerciser the Dreges gave him (he sure loves that), and Karen is helping Mark play. Now you know all about us. The package came day before yesterday and you should see our little lady! She looks so sweet in her new nightie and struts around like a proud peacock. She says, ""Now we's both ladies, Mommie, because we got nighties and the boys haven't."" She and her Daddy are going to fix those paper gadgets into a chain and use them on the Christmas tree, if we're not traveling. Sure hope they hold off with our transfer now till after New Years. Mutt is listed as ""surplus"" now in the 690th and it's a good thing because the squadron is being broken up and some sent to Gallup, New Mexico, some to Terra Amarillo, New Medico (way up in the mountains), and some to ""Cline's Corner"", New Mexico, east of here someplace and they'll be all gone by the 15th, so we missed that move. That's AC and W squadrons, though, still bouncing. We had a nice trip to Porterville. Mutt went to see Marie as she offered him a job at $400 a month plus a down payment on a home if he wanted to get out of the service and clerk in her off-sale liquor store, but we decided against it. War news wasn't so hot when we were thinking about getting out, but won't attempt it now that the situation in Korea is so bad. We wonder so much about the 606th squadron we were in at South Carolina. They're in Korea and we knew most of the men in the squadron. Majority of them married men with families, too. Had a birth announcement from Martha Cats a couple weeks ago and they have their second son. Her husband is in Korea. I feel thankful for every day that Mutt is here, because it will be just a miracle if he isn't sent overseas. Dread that time, but will cross that bridge when and if we come to it. Grannie sent the cutest white felt boots for Mark. Martha Cats sent him a gray and white romper and Doctor Bingham and staff sent a bath blanket and washcloth set. I wrote to Grannie yesterday and will get the other two letters off in a day or so. By the way, we might be getting an allotment check there again. It should be a nice $165. Our pay was pretty short this month as they're getting allotments started and there's always a mixup when they start that. Last November 30, 1949, they gave us $90 instead of the $400 Mutt had coming (in Alaska) and now they messed it all up this November 30. Bad time, just before Christmas for them to get mixed up, but that's life, I guess. I've been teasing Mutt that I'll be supporting him now because my allotment check is bigger than what he draws across the table on pay day. He was getting it all on payday till they started allotments, so it's just six of one and half a dozen of the other. Only difference is that part he gets and part comes in my name now. There were some changes made here while we were in Porterville. Our friend Marguerite made the sad mistake of hanging a man's white shirt and 2 t-shirts on the line one Sunday morning (day before we left for Porterville) and the landlord caught her at the clothesline and talked to her. He looked awful mad-like and she looked like the cat that ate the canary. When we got back, she was gone and we had new neighbors. There was a lady out there the afternoon we got back and I never saw her again, but figured maybe she just stayed in the house all day. Yesterday was cold and raw outside and I went out to empty some garbage about 4:30 and the two little girls were standing in the door of their house and the smallest girl was crying. I asked them if their mamma was home and they said, ""We don't have a mamma. She got killed."" They were so cold they were just blue so I brought them over here till their Daddy came home. He leaves the gas turned on so the house won't be too cold, but the window in the door is broken out so it was pretty cold in there. Betty is 7 and Jean is 6. They have at least 10 blocks to school and have to walk home in the afternoons because their Daddy works and doesn't get home till 5:30 or 6. My heart just ached when I saw them standing in the doorway so cold, and ached a lot more when little Jean said, ""We don't have a mamma. She got killed"". They're good little girls and so well behaved. The older one seems so old for her age. She said her mamma was killed about two years ago and that their Daddy took care of them now. I didn't ask any more questions. Will make it a point though to watch for them after school and bring them in here till their Daddy gets home, though. They were so thrilled over Karen's dolls and doll clothes and all the kids had such a good time after they got acquainted a little bit. The boys are awake in there now, so better get them up and dressed. Karen has dressed herself, so that's done, and Mark just finished a bottle of milk, so he's happy. All for now, and lots of love, Betty.

Now you know all about us. The package came day before yesterday and you should see our little lady! She looks so sweet in her new nightie and struts around like a proud peacock. She says, ""Now we's both ladies, Mommie, because we got nighties and the boys haven't."" She and her Daddy are going to fix those paper gadgets into a chain and use them on the Christmas tree, if we're not traveling. Sure hope they hold off with our transfer now till after New Years. Mutt is listed as ""surplus"" now in the 690th and it's a good thing because the squadron is being broken up and some sent to Gallup, New Mexico, some to Terra Amarillo, New Medico (way up in the mountains), and some to ""Cline's Corner"", New Mexico, east of here someplace and they'll be all gone by the 15th, so we missed that move. That's AC and W squadrons, though, still bouncing. We had a nice trip to Porterville. Mutt went to see Marie as she offered him a job at $400 a month plus a down payment on a home if he wanted to get out of the service and clerk in her off-sale liquor store, but we decided against it. War news wasn't so hot when we were thinking about getting out, but won't attempt it now that the situation in Korea is so bad. We wonder so much about the 606th squadron we were in at South Carolina. They're in Korea and we knew most of the men in the squadron. Majority of them married men with families, too. Had a birth announcement from Martha Cats a couple weeks ago and they have their second son. Her husband is in Korea. I feel thankful for every day that Mutt is here, because it will be just a miracle if he isn't sent overseas. Dread that time, but will cross that bridge when and if we come to it. Grannie sent the cutest white felt boots for Mark. Martha Cats sent him a gray and white romper and Doctor Bingham and staff sent a bath blanket and washcloth set. I wrote to Grannie yesterday and will get the other two letters off in a day or so. By the way, we might be getting an allotment check there again. It should be a nice $165. Our pay was pretty short this month as they're getting allotments started and there's always a mixup when they start that. Last November 30, 1949, they gave us $90 instead of the $400 Mutt had coming (in Alaska) and now they messed it all up this November 30. Bad time, just before Christmas for them to get mixed up, but that's life, I guess. I've been teasing Mutt that I'll be supporting him now because my allotment check is bigger than what he draws across the table on pay day. He was getting it all on payday till they started allotments, so it's just six of one and half a dozen of the other. Only difference is that part he gets and part comes in my name now. There were some changes made here while we were in Porterville. Our friend Marguerite made the sad mistake of hanging a man's white shirt and 2 t-shirts on the line one Sunday morning (day before we left for Porterville) and the landlord caught her at the clothesline and talked to her. He looked awful mad-like and she looked like the cat that ate the canary. When we got back, she was gone and we had new neighbors. There was a lady out there the afternoon we got back and I never saw her again, but figured maybe she just stayed in the house all day. Yesterday was cold and raw outside and I went out to empty some garbage about 4:30 and the two little girls were standing in the door of their house and the smallest girl was crying. I asked them if their mamma was home and they said, ""We don't have a mamma. She got killed."" They were so cold they were just blue so I brought them over here till their Daddy came home. He leaves the gas turned on so the house won't be too cold, but the window in the door is broken out so it was pretty cold in there. Betty is 7 and Jean is 6. They have at least 10 blocks to school and have to walk home in the afternoons because their Daddy works and doesn't get home till 5:30 or 6. My heart just ached when I saw them standing in the doorway so cold, and ached a lot more when little Jean said, ""We don't have a mamma. She got killed"". They're good little girls and so well behaved. The older one seems so old for her age. She said her mamma was killed about two years ago and that their Daddy took care of them now. I didn't ask any more questions. Will make it a point though to watch for them after school and bring them in here till their Daddy gets home, though. They were so thrilled over Karen's dolls and doll clothes and all the kids had such a good time after they got acquainted a little bit. The boys are awake in there now, so better get them up and dressed. Karen has dressed herself, so that's done, and Mark just finished a bottle of milk, so he's happy.

Suppose you've given us up as lost, haven't you?? Wrote you and the Joneses a card to tell you we were moving on the base and this morning Papa Jones remembered he still had them stuck above the sun visor in the car!!  Now ain't that a man for you every time?? Have those kids here with a bowl of vegetable-beef soup in front of each one and they're so sleepy I don't know if they'll manage to eat it or not. They sure are growing. The climate is so dry here that their skin is just like shoe leather and chapped all the time. Sure is nice, though, as we can still slip a sweater on over their clothes and send them outside to play. We're so happy over our house on the base. We have two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bath, and a hallway. Lots of closet and cupboard space, hardwood floors throughout the house and inlaid linoleum on kitchen and bath. Also it is all furnished except curtains and living room furniture. They put in a new drop-leaf dining room table (in the living room, so new I had to tear the paper off it myself), new sideboard in the living room (I'd call it a buffet, but it's listed as a sideboard), and also two chairs and arms (in the living room). We're going to try to get curtains and a davenport payday. We've got wonderful clotheslines, 4 lines clear across the yard, also 2 swings in the backyard, so I know where to find Karen most of the time. The garbage is picked up daily and everything is so clean. There's a speed limit of 10 miles per hour all through the housing area so no worry about kids getting on the highway. Thing I like best, I believe, is that Mutt can come half hour at noon and also 15 minutes in the morning for coffee if he wants to. Sure breaks up the monotony of the day. Seemed like I never saw him enough to chat 5 minutes before, as he left at 6:45 AM and didn't get back till 4:45 PM and now he pops in here every once in awhile. Wouldn't feel a bit bad if they left us here for the next 10 years! By the way, they're going to set up a radar installation about 40 miles north of Devils Lake (Mutt checked on it and it's north of Devils Lake instead of north of Minot), but there won't be living quarters and such available till about a year from now. Here's the payoff, though!!! It is to be considered the same as Alaskan duty and the men who go up there even get overseas points same as the men in Alaska!! How about that??? They must think North Dakota is out of this world someplace. We could volunteer for it if we wanted to, and be almost certain getting it, but think we'll just stay put as long as we can. Wonder if they expect to go seal-hunting up there, too. It sure tickled me when I heard about giving men overseas points for going to North Dakota. Egads! What next!! Expect Mutt to pop in here any minute. He has to go to town to buy a tooth! He has a front tooth bridged in and it broke in half and fell out Friday. He looks about 50 years old now. (That is pretty old looking, isn't it, Mom?? Heh heh heh!) The twins' smallpox vaccinations are finally crusted so maybe they're on the downgrade now. They really had some potent reactions. Must have been new serum. Talk about cross kids!! Ooh!! If somebody had bid a fast nickel they'd have had a couple kids, I think. They're doing pretty well at their potty training now. They're soaked to the ears in the morning, but don't have many wet training pants and very rarely a dirty diaper. We ""pot"" them every hour and what's more, they refuse to sit down to wet now. Richard fights like a madman if you put him on the pot to ""biz"" and he hasn't ""stood-up"" first. Such characters! Mark is growing like a weed. He's got so much hair it feels like peach fuzz. It's about as long as peach fuzz, too! Oh, well, it doesn't matter how long he holds off getting hair, just that many less haircuts. He's been a very good baby and such good entertainment. He turns over now, and gets up on his knees once in a while, but hasn't gotten his shoulders up off the bed yet. Mutt drove by one of the hangars down here so I could see the B-36. Man, is that a huge thing. The tail of it stands as high as the hangar that the other plains are put into for repairs, etc. I don't see how anything that big can get off the ground, but it does. It's got 6 engines plus 4 jets, so it does have a lot of power. Mutt's heart's desire is to be a radar operator on a B-36, but so far they have just officers for that. Sure wish you could see that as it really is something to see. That's one thing about living on the base, you have free air-shows all the time. Yesterday afternoon there were 24 jets flying in formation right over the house, way upstairs, of course. By the way, could I send Grandma Fay's trunk back home? That trip back from Alaska to Seattle, to Michigan, then here just about finished it. It's a wonderful gadget when it comes to packing blankets and pillows and stuff, but it's just too old and it wouldn't take many more moves before we'd have to discard it and hate to throw it away when it's been in the family so long. Right now I think it would hold up till it got there (North Dakota) and would be fine to store stuff in as it's nice and clean on the inside, but if you don't want it, let me know and we'll hang on to it till it falls apart and then get ride of it. Let me know what you think we should do with it, though, will you, please? How are you coming with the Weber house? If you get a chance to rent it, go ahead. Daddy offered it to us to live in if Mutt should go overseas, but we don't want you to let it stand idle when you could be getting rent for it, as we're as undependable as the weather, you know. It wouldn't make us feel a bit bad if they'd forget about us for awhile. By the way, what happened to Mr. Weber, that put the house up for sale?? Last I heard of him, Mom said he was up on the roof fixing shingles. Did he fall off?? Well, another month and I suppose I can go into labor for Helen! The suspense of knowing how it all will turn out and what it will be darned near drives me goofy. Sure sweated out Lillian and Pat's deliveries. Seems like Fritzie's didn't worry me so much because I was home there with everyone else doing the worrying for me, but when we're way far away we have to worry about it all by ourselves. Am anxious to know how many it is, especially. Had a real good letter from Sadie. Now I owe everyone letters. Even had a letter from Aunt Vic. Must answer hers as it is the first one I've ever gotten from her. Have the round robin ready to mail. I've had it a month, so it's about time it got off. Gotta get going. Send us Frank's address, will you? Never know, our paths might cross. Well, you people way up there in that ""out of this world"" place, take care of yourselves!! If we get shipped overseas to Devils Lake, we'll let you know. Darned, if that isn't the funniest thing I've heard in a long time. Makes me chuckle every time I think of it!! Heh heh, foreigners!! That's what you are!! Love, Betty. PS We have a house address now, if you want to use it. Makes no difference. In case you come to see us you'll need it, though. It's 3522 Avenue A, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. There's mail delivery once a day here. Mutt'll get it at the squadron if it's sent there, so there's no difference where you send it.",Dear Folks. ,"Suppose you've given us up as lost, haven't you??

Just got Pat's letter saying Daddy was having trouble with his back, due to arthritis, to thought I'd get a few lines off to you right away, while the dishes soak in the sink and the kids get to sleep for their naps. Was wondering if you folks could come and stay with us till spring?? This climate is noted for it's relief of arthritic conditions and I'll be willing to bet money it would help your back, Daddy. There are still a couple months of cold weather up there which won't do any good for that arthritis and a couple of months in this New Mexico sunshine would likely do wonders for your back.

I'd still be working from 3 to 11, but Mutt could entertain you after 3, and we have a television set now too!! Will that help draw you?? Hog tie him Mom if necessary. One of the men in the 690th that got sent to Montana had it, and he'd have no use for it up there, so we got it for a little bit more than half what he paid for it and it was like new, as they have no children. It's a Philco and we sure like it. Karen gets a kick out of it too,  but it doesn't hold the twins's attention very long. By the way, Mom, the afternoon programs on television are mostly for women!! Just pack your suitcases, take Pop by the arm, catch the nearest plane and you'd be here in a few hours!! Simple, isn't it? The Trans World Airlines airport is just outside the base gate, so we could pick you up there if you flew in, or we'd pick you up in town if you'd come by train. I'd just bet that this climate for a couple months would really help you. Just let us know, will you?? And if you want to catch the next plane out without letting us know, do that and call Mutt at the 690th orderly room and they'll find him and we'll get you on the base!! We're serious about this, so think it over thoroughly and let us know!! One of the nurses at Presbyterian hospital has a husband who has an arthritis of the back and was sent here from Wisconsin and she said he was amazed at how rapidly he improved here. Got to get moving if I'm gonna get the dishes done and the kitchen cleaned up before I go to work. It's always spotless when I come home from work at 11, so I try to leave it that way, when I leave and Mutt takes over. Will be waiting to hear from you and hoping to see you. Love Betty, Mutt, and family. Tuesday, March 12. Gonna add a quick PS as it's 1:30 PM and I have dinner dishes to do yet. We are sending a package to you, Mom, for your birthday.

Have the youngsters all up at the table, so while they eat, I'll scratch a few lines. Then I can dress them and shoo them all out. I had 8 pages written to Helen that I started November 1 and it was almost a diary. I'd added a few lines on duty one evening and forgot the letter and someone threw it away!!!

Kids in bed, dishes soaking, Pa at work, little ironing done, hair pinned up, etc etc etc etc. Got lots of news and don't know where to start. First of all, Technical Sergeant Jones no longer is!! He's Master Sergeant now!!!!!!! As of November 24. We were all hopped up about that and he was just promoted from squadron AC and W supervisor to district AC and W supervisor and we were all excited over that! Then Monday noon, he came home to tell me he was on an overseas shipment for the Far East (Japan, Korea, Okinawa or such place) and sailing date was January 6!! Sick???? I thought our whole world had fallen apart!! Yesterday we got a little encouragement when we found out that 34th Air Division had sent a letter asking that Mutt be taken off the list as he was the only qualified ""70"" (whatever that is) in this area and that he has 53 overseas points while most of the men here have 20 to 22. They said they were sure he'd be taken off, so we have our fingers crossed. Would go to Porterville if he has to go overseas, because Rodney is already coughing and has a little cold and the weather is just cool enough now to wear sweaters instead of coats and am afraid he wouldn't survive North Dakota winters. There's a little 2 bedroom house next to Dad Jones' that Marie owns and said we could rent if Mutt went over, so guess that's where we'll go, if we have to, which we don't think we will now. We're sure hoping, anyway. We got the package and it was just like early Christmas here!! Mutt hasn't used his pot holders yet, but has worn the socks and I've worn both the socks and apron. Everybody enjoyed everything. Kids enjoyed the candy most. Karen's Sunday School teacher called me this morning at 7:45 and said she'd picked Karen and was going to get another little girl and a little boy and the three of them have the welcome for the Christmas program. She said she picked Karen because her face was so ""expressive"" and that she picked up things so fast in Sunday school that she thought it would be easy for her to memorize. The older children are giving a Christmas play and the little ones have ""pieces"" to say. Have some of our Christmas shopping done. By the way, what size shirt do you wear, Daddy? Won't tell you what you're getting but what size shirt do you wear?? Have your birthday present here and will send it in the Christmas package. Now, somebody please tell us what Mamma Mia would like. Any broad hints???? Gotta quit. Love, Betty. PS Tell Helen Mutt said the only bad thing about him making ""Master"" was that Helen would probably demote him to Staff Sergeant next time she writes. One time she demotes him to staff, and then she'd promote him to Master and then maybe next time he'd be down to Technical again.

Got a letter from my little Maggie today, but will write to you tonight and then to her tomorrow night. Well, tis 31 years you two have been hitched. You know you really have accomplished a lot in those years. It's some job to raise a family as big as yours is and especially to give us all an education, too. Think you have every reason in the world to feel pretty proud of yourselves. Wonder if any of us will do nearly as well with our families as you have done with yours. 31 years seems like a long time, but when you stop and realize you have raised a family of seven, given them all the education they wanted, kept them well clothed and well fed, have seen 5 of them married, and a whole gang of grandchildren pop up, it must have been a mighty full 31 years. What it all boils down to is that we send our congratulations to you both on a job well done, and we just love you an awful, awful lot and hope you have many, many more happy years together. Would like to have been there with you, but such is life. We really had a cloudburst last night. They had the CAP out getting people out of homes that were flooded, and most of them worked till early morning. I'll send you some pictures out of the morning paper if the paper isn't gone by the time I get home. Also have some snaps of the kids taken at Easter that I will put in. The one of Mark on his hands and knees I snapped while he was playing ""dog"" and barking at his daddy. Kids sure grow fast, don't they? Can't figure out how kids keep growing up and our parents never seem to get any older. Am so glad Frankie is going to get to go to OCS this fall. Personally I think the service is just the place for him, and bet he will do well at it, for the simple reason he can't quite if he gets mad, and he's at the right age to go on up the ladder. Gosh, I'd just love to see their girls and the Monger girls. Time goes so fast and their only little once. (Sorry, teacher, I got the wrong ""their"" in there). We don't have any babies at our house any more. Darned little Mark didn't stay a baby long enough. Matter of fact, he's the toughest little devil in the block and will tackle anybody or anything. Sure love the little demon, though. Mutt is going to Porterville for Father's Day if everything goes as planned. From the sounds of the letters from there, he's not doing too good again, but he would be able to visit, anyway, if Mutt went out now. He plans to leave Saturday morning before Father's Day and Sergeant Prottengeier and wife and little boy are going to come out Monday and stay till he gets back, so there will be somebody there with the kids when I'm at work. They're from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The name doesn't sound ""Swede-like"", though, does it, Mom. Will take time out and call my family. They all have to talk when I call, but Karen always has the most to say. Well, no news tonight. Jut got them on the line and got a patient in so had to hang up. THey'll be in bed before I get around to calling again, so will have to let it go tonight. Well, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna sign off for this time and one of these days I'll write again.

By the sounds of things you've really been busy again. Makes me mad sometimes the way the city and county expect you to take charge of everything that needs a leader. I know you're a darned good leader and capable of anything they can fire at you, but if they don't quit demanding so much of you, they're going to make a nervous wreck out of you and ruin your health as well. There are other people that could do a few of those things if they just had the backbones to get up off their rear ends and do some of that stuff instead of just saying, ""Let's call Mrs Fay, she'll do it""! They know you're a big-hearted woman and hate to turn them down and sometimes I believe they work on your sympathy till you can't say ""no"". This isn't a lecture, Mom, it's just that I can't see how you do it. All that mental strain of reports to get in and all that stuff that has to be done on a certain day, at a certain hour, is much harder than actual physical work. You're all the Mom we've got and the only Grandma we have left and I couldn't stand to see you end up with ill health ""for the good of the city or the good of the county"". I think you need to get away from Rugby awhile and let them percolate without you. It'd be good for them and you, too. Matter of fact, we've been wondering if there'd be any chance of you coming back with rank and Lil when they come back from furlough, and then come to see us for a couple weeks or months. You don't have anybody in school now and we'd just love to have you here. Seems like ages since we've seen you. Don't suppose Daddy could come now, as it sounds like he's shipping quite a bit of stock and when you've got a living to make, you have to make it where and when you can. He must get awfully worn out riding that cattle train all those miles every week. I'm afraid I'd just crawl in a real bed and sleep my days away between trips if I had to travel that far every week on one of those trains. We hit one like that when we went from Texas to South Carolina and holy Moses we were sore all over from the jerking and stopping of that train. They just had coaches, no pullmans, and the backs of the seats were straight, like on the ""Hong Flyer"". Thought my back would break. I was young, too, so it must be pretty rough on Daddy riding those things. However, if Daddy could come, too, we'd even be tickled pinker!!! Mutt just called me and Mark has a temp of 103 degrees. Karen blossomed out with the mumps on Sunday, so suppose that's what he's getting, too. One consolation is that their bedroom is the coolest in the house and they don't mind being put to bed in there. Karen was fussing so for ""something to do"", so I gave her an American magazine, some scissors and safety pins, and told her she could cut out all the pretty pictures and pin them to the blanket on her bed. She frowned and said, ""That doesn't sounds like fun"". I told her that Grandma Fay did that for Aunt Fritzie when she had scarlet fever only she pinned them on the curtain. Boy, her eyes lit up and she said, ""Did Grandma Fay really do that?"" I told her ""yes"" and by golly she started ""cutting"" and has been at it all day yesterday and all forenoon today!! Happy as a lark, too. She's swollen on both sides, but doesn't have any fever. Suppose the twins will get it, too. Mutt has had it on one side, so he thinks he's immune. I told him that Daddy got it when he had news of his first grandchild, so Mutt had better not feel too sure of his immunity. We'll try to be through with the ""mumps"" series before you come, Mom. See, I've already convinced me that you'll come and see us. How and I doing about convincing you?? Mutt says if I don't get any results, then he will write and try his luck. I have Saturdays and Sundays off and Mutt says we could leave early some Saturday morning and go to Holbrook and see Uncle Cliff. We'd have to leave again Sunday night but could spend all day Sunday there, anyway. He's being transferred to 34th Air division here on the base as an instructor, so would have to be back for classes on Monday. Mutt got back Friday night about 6:30 PM and really enjoyed his visit out there. His Dad is much, much better. He went through the clinic and the doctor told him his heart is in perfectly good condition. There's a tiny scar on his heart, but the doctor said if Dad Jones hadn't told him how sick he'd been he'd never have known it, by the looks of his heart now. Told him he could do anything he felt like doing, including driving his car and going fishing, so he's one happy man. To top matters off, he and old Dad Stamper left to drive back to Porterville last Thursday, by themselves, mind you, with Dad Jones driving!! Marie gave Mutt a ring that she had given Mom Jones years ago and it's mine now and is to go to Karen when I'm old and decrepit. It's a jade, oval-shaped, and has 31 chip diamonds around it, set in platinum. Sure is a pretty thing. Marie and Dad are driving back to Arkansas this fall and are going to spend a few days with us en route. I get so lonesome for ""relatives"" sometimes that I'm tempted to pack up and go visiting, but we can't do that whenever we get the urge or we'd probably be visiting most of the time.

She frowned and said, ""That doesn't sounds like fun"". I told her that Grandma Fay did that for Aunt Fritzie when she had scarlet fever only she pinned them on the curtain. Boy, her eyes lit up and she said, ""Did Grandma Fay really do that?"" I told her ""yes"" and by golly she started ""cutting"" and has been at it all day yesterday and all forenoon today!! Happy as a lark, too. She's swollen on both sides, but doesn't have any fever. Suppose the twins will get it, too. Mutt has had it on one side, so he thinks he's immune. I told him that Daddy got it when he had news of his first grandchild, so Mutt had better not feel too sure of his immunity. We'll try to be through with the ""mumps"" series before you come, Mom. See, I've already convinced me that you'll come and see us. How and I doing about convincing you?? Mutt says if I don't get any results, then he will write and try his luck. I have Saturdays and Sundays off and Mutt says we could leave early some Saturday morning and go to Holbrook and see Uncle Cliff. We'd have to leave again Sunday night but could spend all day Sunday there, anyway. He's being transferred to 34th Air division here on the base as an instructor, so would have to be back for classes on Monday. Mutt got back Friday night about 6:30 PM and really enjoyed his visit out there. His Dad is much, much better. He went through the clinic and the doctor told him his heart is in perfectly good condition. There's a tiny scar on his heart, but the doctor said if Dad Jones hadn't told him how sick he'd been he'd never have known it, by the looks of his heart now. Told him he could do anything he felt like doing, including driving his car and going fishing, so he's one happy man. To top matters off, he and old Dad Stamper left to drive back to Porterville last Thursday, by themselves, mind you, with Dad Jones driving!! Marie gave Mutt a ring that she had given Mom Jones years ago and it's mine now and is to go to Karen when I'm old and decrepit. It's a jade, oval-shaped, and has 31 chip diamonds around it, set in platinum. Sure is a pretty thing. Marie and Dad are driving back to Arkansas this fall and are going to spend a few days with us en route. I get so lonesome for ""relatives"" sometimes that I'm tempted to pack up and go visiting, but we can't do that whenever we get the urge or we'd probably be visiting most of the time. Time out for a sandwich! I'm getting hungry!! Didn't get this finished. Mail man here.","Love, Betty.",0.08481855302507475,0.4867322291235335

I owe Helen and Pat and Fritzie and Frank and Margie letters and found Sadie's (that I'd have sworn I mailed a week ago) in my dressing table drawer today, so imagine it' been some time since you heard from out this way. I can't write letters if I'm not in the mood, and haven't been in the mood for ages it seems. Nothing wrong, just couldn't seem to get a pen and get started. Well, the medical department opened a new medical building this week. Haven't been over to see it yet, but they say it's a beauty.

We bought a 1953 two-tone green Monterey Mercury last Monday. They offered us $2000 and the highest offer we'd had on the other one from anyone else was $1775, so we took it. It's really pretty. Top is very light green (almost white) and the body a medium green. The visibility is what I noticed most. Of course I'm not very well-versed in cars, anyway, but we sure like ""Mercuries"". The dash is all condensed just back of the steering wheel (drawing) and it has a suspended brake pedal instead of the former floor pedal. ""Yours truly"" is going to learn to steer the darned thing, or bust!! That's all there is to do is steer, but I'll probably bust before I learn to do that. Have good intentions, anyway. Mutt had to go to the east radar site on an inspection trip on Wednesday so drove it down there and hit snow and slush all the way, so the ""water-squirting"" windshield wipers have been initiated and found to be really useful. It has ""back-up"" lights, too, so you can see, when you're backing up, just where to go. Am almost convinced that I could drive it. Used to drive your Chevy, Daddy, back in 1943 or 1944 and that never bothered me a bit, but now with 4 little monkeyshines in the back seat I get jittery. Maybe I'm just getting old. I'm so pleased over Karen's hair. I gave her a Prom permanent a year ago and last month and the permanent smell has been in her scalp all that time. Then finally had Johnny DuPris cut it (he did a very good job!) and now it's beginning to curl like it did when she was little (before I gave her the ""Prom"").  Her disposition is even 100% better when she's dressed nice and has her hair curled. They say, ""Clothes don't make the man"", but personal appearance makes a world of difference in a person's self-confidence, I swear!! She got a nice compliment from her ballet teacher last Saturday. Mutt went to pick her up after her lesson at 10 AM and Mrs Johnson told him that Karen had natural talent and a after they had a program in May, she'd like to put Karen in the advanced class. She sure has gotten limber since she started those lessons. She's had them 3 months now and they've been worth every nickel of it. She's crazy about it, too, and though I'm sure she will never be a professional or anything anywhere's near that, it is still a good outlet for her energy. They're also learning the ""hula-hula"" now. Mark can dance ""put yo wide toot wight dah!"" With her, and the twins are like a couple little cows trying to dance, but they think they're pretty good, so I don't say anything. Mark fell in the toilet again the other day!! He had a long sleeved t-shirt on and got both arms soaked to the elbows. He came running out, crying like mad, and said, ""Ain't donna nevah do potty, no mo!!"" I told him I'd change his t-shirt and then he could go potty again, and guess he changed his mind because I'm still wiping ""sprinkle"" marks off the wall back of the toilet. He sure is a poor shot!!! Mutt went to the north site today on an inspection tour and didn't get back till 7 PM, but he had arranged for Sergeant Prottengeier and Gloria and sons to spend the afternoon and evening and babysit so we gabbed all afternoon (they came out about 11, so were here for dinner) and then ""Punk"" (that's Sergeant Prottengeier) and the kids took me to work. We always pay them for ""sitting"", but they don't have a TV and they just love to come out. (They're the kids from Minneapolis). Punk thought he'd just won a million dollars when Mutt told him the car would be at the house so he came up there and got the car and went home and got Gloria and the kids, drove the car to work (3 blocks!), and then took me to work and he was up in seventh heaven to think Mutt would let him drive a car that new!! They're real nice kids, about Frank's age, I think. She reminds me a lot of Fritzie Fay Shuler. Anybody hear anything about how Frank and Lil are making out. I don't know, I may be way off, but I can't help but feel someday Frankie will really wake up and appreciate his little family. They seemed so happy when we were there in October and Lil said then that they'd been getting along real well and really looked sincere about it. Was so surprised to hear they were having trouble. Wonder what went wrong? Later. Well, it's 10 AM, so time to close shop. Mutt called at 11:40 PM and he was just getting to bed. He was up at 5:30 this morning as they left at 6:30, and has inspection in the morning at 8:30 so will have to get his uniform pressed in the morning.

Swore I was going to just stop and write to you on your birthday, Mom, but got company that day and don't know what has happened since then. Can't seem to find many spare minutes and still don't seem to get half of things done that I'd like to. First off, the box came the 13th, and talk about excitement!! The bedspreads went right on the beds and when anyone comes in the door, Dougie says, ""Come see my bed"", and repeats it till somebody pays attention. They sure make the boys bedroom look nice! Got a kick out of the twins. I was helping Mark and Dougie put their new spreads on their beds and Richard and Rodney were helping each other with their spreads. They just started to unfold it and Richard said (solemn as a judge), ""Don't drop this Rodney! It's as precious as the American flag!!"" He meant it, too! The twins shirts fit perfect. Mark's was long in the sleeves, but he had to wear his to Sunday school last Sunday, so I turned the cuffs up and he wore it. It will fit him perfect by next fall. He's at that ""in between"" size now and is hard to fit. Karen was especially pleased over the North Dakota coin purse. She had been after me for a long time to get her a coin purse to carry her Scout money in and I'd just never remember it when I was downtown. The socks were super! She needed some and I hadn't gotten those, either. She's worn the gloves to school every day and believe when it's 100 degrees in the shade, she will still wear them. She has read the ""ballet"" book a couple times so I know she liked that. She's not much of a letter writer so don't suppose she will ever get a letter off to you. She has the speed of her mother, and now I know how I must have irked you when I was growing up! She is so slow that I could give her a swift kick in the pants most of the time, but find out she does much better if I can count ten and leave her alone and just not watch her!! We have the pillows on the couch in the living room and they look so nice. I didn't have any pillow at all on the couch and that was a future project that I'd probably have accomplished about 1960, so I'm glad you sent them and I'll just cross that project off the list. Have used the cheeseboard every day (didn't have a breadboard, that was another future product!). Used the ""egg separator"" and that works like a charm! The ""Red River potatoes"" flour scoop is in use, the dish towel in the drawer, and the measuring cups!!!! They're beautiful! Don't have them on the wall yet, but they'll be there! Well, Daddy, does Mom look any older now than she did a week ago?? Did you get any birthday cake, or are you on a diet??? I got up to 125 pounds and my uniforms were choking me around the middle, so cut down my starches for about 10 days and am back to 120 pounds and can breathe in my uniforms again. We are having a cement block wall built around our yard. The sand is all blowing away and we had to do something to save our property or we were going to have a house sitting on the foundation with no yard left. It will be nice when it's finished, but is party expensive. Sure am glad I have an education in a field that is in demand and that I can work evening hours. I'm only working part time and get $14 a day (for 8 hours) so it's not bad. They're so short of help that I can name my own hours and my own days, so that helps. We've started the kids in the little Lutheran Church here. It's just a few blocks from our house and they just started a junior choir and all of the kids are singing in it. The woman who directs it obviously has had some voice training because they don't just ""sing"", they first spend a few minutes singing up and down the scales and she kept saying, ""Now don't slide up and down from one key to another."" Reminded me of Fritzie and I and ""Ciribiribin""! I can still see you, Mom, sitting there on the old davenport with your eyes shut, listening, while Fritzie and I went over and over it till we quit ""sliding."" I planted a pan of tomato seeds and holy smokes, every darned one of them grew, so I just got the last of them transplanted yesterday. Soooo I have tomato plants enough for the whole squadron and most of the neighborhood. Oh, well, we all like tomatoes. Mutt got some posts and a couple pieces of pipe, so it won't be long till the kids have a swing and a chinning bar in the back yard. We have so many things we plan to do to this place if Uncle Sam just leaves us here and it looks like he will. We're really enjoying ourselves here and just love our location. I know we'll hate to leave here when the day comes, but we don't even think about that! Still haven't finished Karen's Easter dress and she has to have it next Thursday for their Easter program at school. Maybe I should get to work. I have the breakfast and lunch dishes soaking. I'm real talented at soaking dishes!! Everybody has a talent you know and that's mine, soaking dishes!! I cleaned, scrubbed, and waxed the whole house yesterday except the kitchen and everything looked so nice. Have to get the kitchen done now while Dougie is sleeping. If only it would last! The sand here is awfully hard on the wax or maybe it's just so many feet going across it all the time. Well, do you suppose I should get busy?? Hate to! I'm real comfortable here in the rocking chair with my feet on a footstool, but guess the floor won't wash itself and reckon the dishes are pretty well soaked by now. I go to work at 5 tonight. Work 5 to 11 tomorrow night, too, and then am hospital supervisor on 3 to 11 Saturday and Sunday. I didn't work last Sunday and Gladys and Willie Holmberg (down the street) and their kids and Pa and I and our 5 went mountain climbing. It was lots of fun, but didn't realize how ""soft"" I'd gotten from lack of such exercise. The kids really enjoyed it and Dougie ""hiked"" most of the way on Mutt's shoulders and when we got to the car he said, ""Oh, I'm so tired, Daddy!"" And Mutt said, ""You're tired???"" And Dougie said, ""Yes, Daddy, I'm soooo tired."" He was, too, but it sounded so funny coming from him when he'd been carried almost all the way! That darned Mutt never puffed at all! Guess he ain't as old as I tell him he is!! Here I am turning gray haired as the dickens and he came up to me one day and asked me to pull out the one gray hair he had in his head!! I just said, ""Won't do it, son!!"" Oh, well, people will think he's a nice kid to take such good care of his ""Mother""!! Ha ha ha ha!! Gotta get to work or I'll get fired!

Can you smell the chili cooking?? Smells good from here! Kids are all at the pool, so decided to take advantage of these few minutes and get a line off to you. By the sounds of your letter, Mom, you people have really had the company. Sure sounded like fun and just think of all the good chatter I missed out on! Darn it all, anyway! Things manage to keep exciting around here, too! Richard and Rodney went fishing last week and we had fried fish for supper (catfish). It was their first catch worth eating and they were good fish. Yesterday the boys went hiking and brought in cattails and black-eyed susans, and a turtle! We now have a banana box on the floor in Mark's and Doug's bedroom with sand in the bottom of it, a private sunken swimming pool (pie pan) with sundeck (rock) and one turtle about 3 inches in diameter. After we got the housework pretty well done today, Mark and Rodney went fishing as it was cloudy, but by the time they got out there, the sun came out bright and it got real hot so they didn't fish. Doug, Richard, Karen, and I fixed a picnic lunch and walked out there at noon and here were those boys catching tadpoles and ""crawdads"". We picked fresh blackberries on our walk back and ate too many so didn't have enough for a pie, but they were sure good. Rodney and Mark thought they knew where there were a whole bunch of blackberries, so took a paper bag and went to pick blackberries. Someone else had gotten there first, so instead of blackberries, they came back with a fuzzy caterpillar on a twig. At the present time we now have: one turtle in his private apartment, one jar of water with two crawdads, one jar of water with tadpoles (food for the turtle and does he love ‘em!), and one jar with dirt in the bottom and leaves and twigs and a caterpillar in it.We hatched a moth from a chrysalis last week and he's already mounted in an insect box. All the boys are working on their insect badge and no bug is safe around here! Now for news of my better half. He was called down to the commander's office at Goose Bay Air Defense Center (not to his colony's office there at the site, but the ""center"" commander's) when the promotion list came out and told he was most deserving of the promotion and the colonel was dumbfounded not to see his name on the list (they promoted 742 warrants out of a possible 1400!) and said he was going to check to see why. Well, they chased it to Grand Forks, and there Lieutenant Colonel Silvernail had written an ER on Mutt when he left there and hadn't shown it to Mutt, but had it attached to his records! He down-graded Mutt 4 blocks lower than he'd ever been graded before (in over 20 years!) and had him classified as a ""very fine officer"" which means in general, that you do the duties assigned but at the same time doesn't give credit for the extra jobs he had and responsibilities he had which they wouldn't delegate to Silvernail because he wasn't capable. There is a regulation which entitles every man to see his ER before it is attached to his records and challenge it if he thinks it unjust. This makes the ER worthless and Grand Forks is now in the process of contesting the ER and it will be discarded from Mutt's record and replaced with what he deserves. Here's the catch, though! This ER was on the record when the promotion board reviewed them, and as Mutt says, ""What were they to presume but that after 20 years of Excellent and Outstanding ERs and then a man completes his 20 years and immediately drops 4 blocks lower, it appears as though his idea is that now that he has 20 years in, he doesn't give a darn and is just going along for the ride!"" There is no way he can get the promotion until next year, though, as they had 742 promotions to pass out this year and they passed out 742, so he's out of luck on that. What really was nasty, was that Silvernail wasn't authorized even to write the ER because he hadn't worked over Mutt the required number of days (60 I believe) to even have any right to write it. To make matters more interesting, Silvernail was to be ""forced retired"" when Kennedy decided to call up the reserves, etc, and and retained these ""forced retirees"" for 2 more years, because he had been passed over twice on promotion to Lieutenant Colonel as being ""unqualified"", but when Kennedy extended him the 2 years they had to make him Lieutenant Colonel!! He worked on the ""TOR"" team with Mutt and Captain Painter for awhile right after they came back from Kansas City the summer of 1959 when we came to Grand Forks, but that didn't last long, as they put Silvernail on shift work because he couldn't handle responsibility and it also hurt his ego when they left Mutt on there the whole 3 years we were there and also made Mutt ""Eyes Only"" officer (the only one that knew when these alerts were going to be pulled). Think the man was jealous and decided he'd be dirty and that he was!! At the time of this promotion business, they were also getting set for a big ""ORI"" exercise at the site at Goose Bay, and the evaluation team from the states just sent them their report. They passed with an ""outstanding"" rating, and I quote from Mutt's letter. ""Now the cream for sour apples and I quote, ‘The Recovery Officer, Weapon Assignment Officer, Air Surveillance Officer, Interceptor Director, and Identification Officer performed in such a manner that only outstanding knowledge and devotion to duty could allow them to function in the manner just completed.'"" Now Mutt holds 2 of those 5 positions that were rated outstanding!! Needless to say, he is very bitter, however, he does not blame the promotion board, because they have time to judge only by the records in front of them and Silvernail's dirty work was on there! Unjustly and illegally, but it was there, and did the damage that can't be rectified. That stinker has the nicest wife and their little boys walked by our house to school, and many and many's the time I took them to school with Doug and Mark and brought them home when it was so cold. Their kids are cute as can be! Don't know the oldest boy, as he ran away from home and joined the Navy while we were in Grand Forks, but the little boys are cute as can be and well behaved little fellows. Silvernail himself is quite effeminate with blonde, curly hair and I overheard quite a few comments about it in Grand Forks (at the base) and several of the men made comments about the ""Silvernail touch"" in regards to the way he held his liquor glass so daintily with his little finger curled out so pretty, but never dreamed he was capable of such poison. Mutt will be home for a day or so the middle of August, and by that time he should have something in writing from Grand Forks. We'll sure be glad to see him, I tell you!! Had a letter from him today saying he was being sent to ""Saglik"" yesterday for 5 days, so Lieutenant Sharples could come to Goose Bay to get his necessary paperwork taken care of to ""rotate"" (return to states). He was in Grand Forks, he's served his year in Labrador and is being sent to New York. His wife (German girl) is still in Larimore. This letter of his was written at 3 AM as he'd just gotten home from work. They'd called a surprise exercise to check them on coming up to full battle duty and they accomplished it in record time. Good to know they're a sharp team up there, anyway! Tell Pat we'll take that red headed boy, anytime!! Bet he was supposed to be mine!! My neighbor (due July 2) still hasn't delivered and is getting pretty uncomfortable. Kids are in from the pool, starved as usual. Better feed them. Enjoyed our chat!!

At the present time we now have: one turtle in his private apartment, one jar of water with two crawdads, one jar of water with tadpoles (food for the turtle and does he love ‘em!), and one jar with dirt in the bottom and leaves and twigs and a caterpillar in it.We hatched a moth from a chrysalis last week and he's already mounted in an insect box. All the boys are working on their insect badge and no bug is safe around here! Now for news of my better half. He was called down to the commander's office at Goose Bay Air Defense Center (not to his colony's office there at the site, but the ""center"" commander's) when the promotion list came out and told he was most deserving of the promotion and the colonel was dumbfounded not to see his name on the list (they promoted 742 warrants out of a possible 1400!) and said he was going to check to see why. Well, they chased it to Grand Forks, and there Lieutenant Colonel Silvernail had written an ER on Mutt when he left there and hadn't shown it to Mutt, but had it attached to his records! He down-graded Mutt 4 blocks lower than he'd ever been graded before (in over 20 years!) and had him classified as a ""very fine officer"" which means in general, that you do the duties assigned but at the same time doesn't give credit for the extra jobs he had and responsibilities he had which they wouldn't delegate to Silvernail because he wasn't capable. There is a regulation which entitles every man to see his ER before it is attached to his records and challenge it if he thinks it unjust. This makes the ER worthless and Grand Forks is now in the process of contesting the ER and it will be discarded from Mutt's record and replaced with what he deserves. Here's the catch, though! This ER was on the record when the promotion board reviewed them, and as Mutt says, ""What were they to presume but that after 20 years of Excellent and Outstanding ERs and then a man completes his 20 years and immediately drops 4 blocks lower, it appears as though his idea is that now that he has 20 years in, he doesn't give a darn and is just going along for the ride!"" There is no way he can get the promotion until next year, though, as they had 742 promotions to pass out this year and they passed out 742, so he's out of luck on that. What really was nasty, was that Silvernail wasn't authorized even to write the ER because he hadn't worked over Mutt the required number of days (60 I believe) to even have any right to write it. To make matters more interesting, Silvernail was to be ""forced retired"" when Kennedy decided to call up the reserves, etc, and and retained these ""forced retirees"" for 2 more years, because he had been passed over twice on promotion to Lieutenant Colonel as being ""unqualified"", but when Kennedy extended him the 2 years they had to make him Lieutenant Colonel!! He worked on the ""TOR"" team with Mutt and Captain Painter for awhile right after they came back from Kansas City the summer of 1959 when we came to Grand Forks, but that didn't last long, as they put Silvernail on shift work because he couldn't handle responsibility and it also hurt his ego when they left Mutt on there the whole 3 years we were there and also made Mutt ""Eyes Only"" officer (the only one that knew when these alerts were going to be pulled). Think the man was jealous and decided he'd be dirty and that he was!! At the time of this promotion business, they were also getting set for a big ""ORI"" exercise at the site at Goose Bay, and the evaluation team from the states just sent them their report. They passed with an ""outstanding"" rating, and I quote from Mutt's letter. ""Now the cream for sour apples and I quote, ‘The Recovery Officer, Weapon Assignment Officer, Air Surveillance Officer, Interceptor Director, and Identification Officer performed in such a manner that only outstanding knowledge and devotion to duty could allow them to function in the manner just completed.'"" Now Mutt holds 2 of those 5 positions that were rated outstanding!! Needless to say, he is very bitter, however, he does not blame the promotion board, because they have time to judge only by the records in front of them and Silvernail's dirty work was on there! Unjustly and illegally, but it was there, and did the damage that can't be rectified. That stinker has the nicest wife and their little boys walked by our house to school, and many and many's the time I took them to school with Doug and Mark and brought them home when it was so cold. Their kids are cute as can be! Don't know the oldest boy, as he ran away from home and joined the Navy while we were in Grand Forks, but the little boys are cute as can be and well behaved little fellows. Silvernail himself is quite effeminate with blonde, curly hair and I overheard quite a few comments about it in Grand Forks (at the base) and several of the men made comments about the ""Silvernail touch"" in regards to the way he held his liquor glass so daintily with his little finger curled out so pretty, but never dreamed he was capable of such poison. Mutt will be home for a day or so the middle of August, and by that time he should have something in writing from Grand Forks. We'll sure be glad to see him, I tell you!! Had a letter from him today saying he was being sent to ""Saglik"" yesterday for 5 days, so Lieutenant Sharples could come to Goose Bay to get his necessary paperwork taken care of to ""rotate"" (return to states). He was in Grand Forks, he's served his year in Labrador and is being sent to New York. His wife (German girl) is still in Larimore. This letter of his was written at 3 AM as he'd just gotten home from work. They'd called a surprise exercise to check them on coming up to full battle duty and they accomplished it in record time. Good to know they're a sharp team up there, anyway! Tell Pat we'll take that red headed boy, anytime!! Bet he was supposed to be mine!! My neighbor (due July 2) still hasn't delivered and is getting pretty uncomfortable. Kids are in from the pool, starved as usual. Better feed them. Enjoyed our chat!!","All my love, Betty",0.16857072210197205,0.5442905242905242

Just took all the kids to vacation Bible school, so will take a few minutes to  tell you we are really not dead or haven't left the country. Mutt came home Tuesday 7th at 6:30 AM and left yesterday morning at 10. Sure hated to see him go again but we had a wonderful vacation while he was here. We went to Washington DC one morning and went through part of the Smithsonian Institute and the aquarium in the department of commerce. Saw Sheppard's capsule in the aerospace building and the Kitty Hawk of the Wright brothers, and the animals of every description in the main part of the Smithsonian. You could spend a couple days there and still not see all there is to see. Mutt and I went to DC alone early one morning and went to the Pentagon to look at his service records. Saw them all, and Silvernail's ER is still in there, but after seeing it, I can't see there was anything exactly derogatory in it, it just neglected to mention all the extra projects and jobs he's had and completed with high praise. Mutt talked by phone to the fellow in the WO promotion office and he said that they turned down fellows with over 20 years service because they thought they'd take the promotion and run. This doesn't make sense because Mutt is regular instead of reserve and the Air Force can hold him for 30 years if they desire. The fellow said there were a lot of burned up warrants and he felt they had a reason to be burned up, but once a promotion has been doled out, they can only take it away by court-martial. They can't tell you why you weren't selected, where you stood promotion-wise, what they judged on or anything, so you really can find out very little. After talking to that fellow, he called the man in charge of retirement and he said he thought Mutt would have little trouble getting retirement approved and also told him to try to arrange to get his eye operated on at once and they'd have to send him to Walter Reed and if they'd transfer him to the Department of Patients there, and Mutt would notify him, he'd have him out of service in three weeks. We went up to see Colonel Falletta in his office in the Pentagonwhile we were there. He and Mutt and Prottenglier worked together in Albuquerque. He asked what the h___ Mutt was doing here and when Mutt told him checking on retirement, he started telling him how much the service needed men like him, so before he went any further, Mutt  told him about the promotion list and why he was retiring. Colonel Falletta had his feet up on his desk and when he heard that Mutt didn't make the promotion, his feet hit the floor so fastI thought he was going to fall out of his chair! He says, wellllll after hearing that I guess I can save my speech! He's an old Texas boy and common as an old shoe (looks like that short one of the Abbet and Costello team) but is a brilliant fellow according to Mutt. Course he and Mutt were going back-and-forth with remember this time and what ever happened to so-and-so, and they caught up on a lot of fellows that one or the other had lost track of. Know they both enjoyed the visit and they both had some good laughs on memories of Albuquerque. We went back to DC another day and rode the elevator to the top of the Washington Monument and walked down!! Thought my knees would never quit bending even after I got out on the sidewalk. The view from the top of that is beautiful!! Mutt went to the Federal Aviation Agency to check on job qualifications, etc., while we toured the monument, and then we all went to the Lincoln Memorial and then to the wax museum and by the time we got back to the car, we were really beat! Still want to see the White House and the Capitol on the inside before we leave here. Traffic is terrific, though! We went to DC to a Sears store one day, too, and got the kids clothes for school (and three new dresses for me for my birthday!!). Mark and Doug had an extra good birthday because Daddy was home. They each had a cake and it was another one of those unplanned birthday parties before it was over. Had 26 people that finally got cake, ice cream, and punch or coffee! Started out with just the two girls across the hall, and the four kids next-door to them, and then the mamas came in and then the daddys came home from work, and then Rodney's, Richard's, and Mark's buddies heard there was cake and all came to visit! It was fun though and Mutt met all the neighbors (except the prostitutes next-door! I didn't introduce him to them!!!).  Saturday morning we drove to Annapolis to the Naval Academy so the boys could see that, and really lucked out! They were having a big parade and review for Change of Command and it was really impressive! We got there at 10:45 AM and the program and parade started at 11 AM. Don't know how often they change commands at an Academy, but we really hit it at the right time. We drove up towards Baltimore one day, too, and out to Fort Meade several times. Mutt had dinner with retired Colonel Davis (retired from Grand Forks in June '61) while I went commissarying at Fort Meade one day. At any rate, we did a little housekeeping except for eating and washing dishes while Mutt was home and it sure looks it today!! He and the boys were at the pool a couple hours every day and he got a nice suntan (burned, too, but where it's peeling, it's tan underneath!) and they really hung onto him and he looked like the Pied Piper every time he went out the door! He had a gang of boys at the ballpark playing baseball a couple days, too. Really utilized every minute he had and know he hated to head back, but left with a letter all written to the Secretary of the Air Force requesting immediate retirement and stating his reasons why. This will go (properly) through channels so will be endorsed by his CO at the site, the CO at Goose Bay Air Defense Command, then to Colorado Springs to be endorsed and then to the secretary of the Air Force and back to Mutt, so will likely take several months, but we at least know definitely now that he is going to retire (if they approve it and they'd better now!!) at least by April 1. As soon as he gets a retirement date, he can start checking on employment, but must have a definite date before anyone will even accept an application, which is understandable. Found out several other things about several of the WO's that made the promotion. Smith (at Grand Forks) was an alcoholic and supposed to work in weather, but came to work so drunk so often that he couldn't navigate nor do his work, so was sent to the motor pool to work where he didn't have to do any technical work. Albright, who was with us in South Carolina and visited us in Alubquerque and in Michigan and had same date of rank as Mutt but less years of service, had been thrown out of Alaska by the commander there because he would get along with no one and caused so much dissention among the personnel. He made W3, though. When Colonel Davis heard they made Kimbrell and not Mutt, his reply was, That d___ fellow never did anything but sit on his a__ the whole time he was in Grand Forks! Made him so mad, that he is writing a letter to Director of Personnel in DC, just to express his opinion! Says it will be his first act as a civilian, but it might help make them wake up and revise their promotional policies. At any rate, we've had a wonderful vacation, seen lots of the country, and know we'll all remember these few days a long, long time. Guess I've yakked long enough (an hour and a half), and wanted to wash my dirty wig before the kids come home, so guess I'd better go stick my head in the sink! Lots of love to both of you and will let you know what we hear on retirement.

There are 1035 in his class, so he feels he was real lucky to make it. Haven't heard from him since Sunday but they were to go out on bivouac Monday for three weeks so suppose we won't hear for awhile. He says it's rough but he still likes it. He's planning on Rich making it next year. Rich is all registered, etc. at College of Marin here and will stay home and commute to school.

I cleaned out my closet yesterday and found 4 wool skirts that have been ""hanging"" waiting to be shortened. Took them to the tailor on base and they wanted $3.50 for each skirt, so I guess you know I brought them right back home again! I'll do it myself when I retire in Santa Monica! You know it just dawned on me that I think Marvin Myhre is working for SDC (some company Mutt is going to work for!). I have their ""Granada Hills"" address, if they're still there. Will have to check with Leona while I'm there in Rugby. I moved Doug in with Rich last night so I can use Doug's bedroom for packing and sorting. I have stuff torn up real good all over the place and have little piles of ""don't anybody touch"" all over. Nobody touches either! They're such nice people here! Doug was so excited last night. He called from his bedroom, ""Mom, Mom, come here quick!"" I about broke my neck getting in there and he was so excited and said, ""Listen, Mom, listen!"" I listened, but couldn't figure out what he was talking about and finally he said, ""Look! I'm breathing through my nose!"" He hasn't done that for over a month, so guess it was something to be excited about. He got a different antihistamine from the doctor last Monday and evidently it's working. He got up looking so rested this morning. I'm sure he had a light asthma attack last Friday, and explained it to the doctor and he said he was sure that's what it was, too. It's the first time he's ever done that. He says he's getting a ""C or C"" in PE, too, because he just didn't have enough air to run far enough. The classes are so large that the teachers just don't have time to check to see if there's a reason they can't keep up. Mark's graduation announcement came in last night so I cornered Mark and we got those out. Also got Becky's and Donita's graduation gifts off, so have Randy's left and haven't gotten his yet. Boys are harder to shop for than girls are, but I'll get at that soon. I work Saturday and Sunday, go to a NORAD luncheon Monday noon in Novato, and I work Thursday and Friday (30 and 31) and then I'm through (working for money, that is!). Must go or I'll miss my dental appointment. Time is creeping by fast and we'll see you soon.

They hadn't had breakfast yet, so I was in the kitchen frying bacon and I heard Mark yell, ""Hey, guys, I got mine!"" Next thing I knew, Alex disappeared. He wasn't gone long, and pretty soon he came into the kitchen and said, ""Mrs. Jones, do I have to fill that carton?"" I kept a straight face and said, ""No, Alex, you don't have to fill it to the top!"" Then Tim disappeared and I thought maybe he'd fallen in, because he was in the bathroom quite awhile and finally he came out looking exhausted and said, ""Ahhh, at last!!"" I didn't dare laugh at them because this was a serious project to them, but it isn't every day that young men come for breakfast and then hold up breakfast while they get a stool specimen. There's a bathroom right there at the dispensary but I guess they never thought of that. I had them run it up to the lab before I'd finish their breakfast! They're really a trio. The house was like a three ring circus yesterday and seemed like I cooked and washed dishes all day, but I'm more content on those days than I am when I have all that horrible peace and quiet! Doug had accordion lessons yesterday. Started him with a new teacher, an old Italian and think he's going to be real good. Doug sure likes him. Had another letter from Rod yesterday. Their squadron won the ""Golden Jock"" for intramural sports (took first in all 7 sports and it's the first time one squadron has done that) and also won the ""Golden Shoe"" for marching, so they're in first for the 81st Fighter Wing trophy given to the best squadron at the end of the summer.

Had a letter from Karen (that was ""approved and censored by Jim"") and she said Mama Gene's father passed away several weeks ago. He had cancer and they'd been up to see him a couple months ago. Mutt leaves Tuesday and will be gone till the end of the week, I think, and then will be gone three weeks in August.

Mark came home from classes at 11 AM Friday with a temp of 101.6 and it was 103 degrees all day Saturday and the doctor says ""flu"", so he's back to school today. He's still blowing his nose like mad, and coughing a little, but his temp was normal all day yesterday and he even ""looks"" like Mark today. Yesterday the Scouts had a meeting here at 10 AM and the Scoutmaster was here till 4 PM. He's a young fellow, about 25, getting married December 21, and Mark is his assistant Scoutmaster and I could tell Ed just didn't want to go back to his barracks. He's a nice young man and really good with the Scouts. Karen and Jim were over Sunday evening and we just gabbed and gabbed. Jim plans to go to Long Beach State College next year, so they'll be moving next summer. It sure has been nice to have them close this year. Mutt is supposed to find out this week sometime about where his job will be and we're sure anxious! He is in an apartment alone and much happier with this than the other arrangement he had. This little apartment is so clean, and it's much quieter, and then he doesn't have Hal to contend with. That man was the sloppiest, dirty fellow and it's hard to imagine him a lieutenant colonel, but he was. Rich came home from classes yesterday all elated! He was really sweating out his ""statistics"" class midterm and got it back yesterday with an ""A"" on it, so he was really tickled. He's gotten a B and a B-plus and this A on his midterms but only got a C-minus on his Italian midterm. He's taking that on a ""pass-fail"", so doesn't worry too much about it, but sure works hard on that course. They're allowed to take one course on a ""pass-fail"" basis and if they pass it, they still get credit for it but the grade isn't figured into the grade point average, and if they fail it, it doesn't go on their record as a fail. He was debating on whether to take ""stats"" or ""Italian"" on pass-fail and he evidently picked the right one. Peggy is coming down for Thanksgiving. He thinks he's convinced her to stay in nursing school. I sure hope so, because she's getting real good grades and she just misses Rich and I can understand that, too. Rich is going to Berkeley next year, so he will be able to see her on weekends, so then she will be happy. Mark came home from Terra Linda Homecoming and he says ""Now I think I'm in love,"" and I said, ""Oh, no, not another one!"" and he just chuckled! He's such a nut, I can't imagine him loving one. We had our conference with Mr. Airey and the accordion salesman last Saturday and wheeeeee, by paying $60.28 a month for 3 years and trading in Doug's accordion we could get him the big accordion and amplifier. They'd allow us $271.75 for Doug's accordion and we'd still have to pay $2170.08, so we said, ""No, thank you."" It includes ""teacher training"" in Santa Ana on Saturdays, but we won't be here to take advantage of that. The salesman said, ""Well, I'll bring over an accordion and amp from Santa Ana this week, anyway, and you'll change your mind and buy it anyway this week."" He's so darned ""pushy"" and I balk like a mule at a salesman like that! The only advantage this expensive accordion has is the amplification, and about three more switches to change the sound, and the keyboard is a faster action, so the keys come back up quicker and it's easier to play faster, but even Doug thought that was way too much money for the difference in the machine. If we were going to stay here with Mr. Airey for three years, it might be worth it, but not otherwise. These darned salesmen talk so fast and furious that the sum total doesn't hit you till after you're home and put it on paper. I always think it's a good idea to get the figures, come home and think it over at least 24 hours and then decide. We've eliminated a lot of high pressure buys that way. They say, ""It's only ‘so much' a month"" and it doesn't sound so bad, until you add on their carrying charges and that's a different picture! Well, I reckon I'd better get dressed and get out of here. Gotta go to the bank to deposit Rich's check for him and get some money for us in here at this house. Have a kitchen full of dirty dishes, too. I went to bed (with dishes stacked in the sink) last night and that was a mistake. It's such a mess in the morning, but can't blame anyone but me! I sure did things differently when I was working! Got a lot more stuff done, but didn't do the ""fun projects"" I do now. Didn't sit around till 10 AM in my robe and gown, either!

Looks like it's going to be a pretty day. The sun is shining and there's a cool breeze, but I sure miss the birds. You just hear ""people"" noises here, like trucks and cars and kids and dogs, but no birds. We had the nicest trip to San Rafael to see the kids. Northern California (especially the Mount Shasta area) is so pretty now, but guess they really get the snow in the winter, too. We spent one night at the Holiday Inn where Mark works ""room service."" He came knocking on our door about 10 AM and when I opened it he said, ""Excuse me, Lady, but I have to use your bathroom."" I told him that we'd never had ""room service"" like that before and he just laughed. Rich came over Friday after class (PM) and then the boys and Dad went to the stock car races in Petaluma Friday night. We went to see Winnie and Emory (Mutt's cousins) Saturday PM. They're the best people. That Winnie is about 64, weighs about 95 pounds and just bubbles with energy. Emory was head of California State Highway Patrol for quite a few years before he retired. He has diabetes, so has lost some weight since we saw him last, but he says he feels good and just can't eat as much anymore, but says he doesn't miss all the extra stuff he was eating before. Doug is still sleeping. He's ""14"" today and Mark is 19. I'm going to make a small birthday cake for Doug and then will make one for Mark when he gets home at the end of the month. Took Doug to Wards yesterday and he got a new shirt, some ""flared leg trousers and a brown suede belt and he thinks he's the sharpest thing in town. Even came home and polished his shoes so they'd look good and then he sat here all spruced up and waited for Mutt to come home from work. Most of the trousers Doug's size have longer legs and if you shorten them, you lose the ""taper,"" and these had 25.5 inch inseam instead of 28 inch so fit perfect. (Now watch the son of a gun grow and you can't lengthen these either.) Got Doug all set in school. He's going to be taking English, Spanish I, Biology, Algebra, PE, and Frosh Choir. He still says he wants to be a doctor, so I asked him if he planned to sing his patients back to health, since he's taking choir and he said, ""Sure."" School starts September 3. Got him lined up with an orthodontist (only one in town) and ""visited"" him yesterday. Today we have a 1 PM appointment with an accordion teacher. I'm still thinking seriously about seeing if I can find part-time work after school starts. suppose Maria is in Minneapolis now. I would think that would be very interesting. Doris Chabot's daughter is taking a similar course, I guess, in Ashland, Oregon. I think she said Debbie goes to St. Louis, Missouri for four weeks after she finishes in Ashland. Got a letter from our neighbors in Virginia and the Kettlewell's (he's the fellow with no legs) had a 10.5 pound son on August 6. She was due the same time Sadie is. Sure a good thing she didn't go any longer or she'd have had an elephant! Everyone was kidding Pat and Don (Kettlewell) so, and telling them that Pat looked like she was going to have twins, and she really was huge, much bigger than Sadie is. Am sure they're glad it's just one, though, especially with Don and his Buerger's disease. Mom, do you remember the Prottenglier's? They were stationed with us in Albuquerque and then were at Minot when we were at Grand Forks. He was a radio announcer at Minot and they were at a picnic we had in Minot one summer (1959??) (must have been July because I made doll birthday cake for Mona and Maria and brought them to the picnic). We went to their apartment a little while after the picnic. Gloria & Punk (or ""Paul Arthur"" as he's called on radio) had 5 boys. Well, anyway, while we were at Frank's I got Punk's mother's address out of the Minneapolis phone directory and wrote her when we got here. Was a bit shocked when I got her letter and found out they're divorced and Punk married a Minot divorcee with a 13-year-old son in 1962. Gloria has the 5 boys and is still in Billings, Montana where they went from Minot. Punk and Darlene are in Florida and both work for a radio station there. We had lost track of them since they were in Minot. Their oldest boy has a full scholarship to Stanford, so must be a pretty bright boy. He's the same age as Mark. Then they have boys 17, 16, 14, and 12. Anyway, we felt pretty badly when we heard about it. It must be awfully hard on the boys with no father around and also hard for Gloria to raise 5 boys by herself. The boys take turns going to visit their Dad, one boy each summer so that means they see him once every 5 years!! The 17-year-old had trouble of some sort in school last year, so has to repeat his junior year, so there'll be 2 in junior class this year. We got a letter from Punk this week. I wrote to Gloria, but haven't heard from her, and Punk's mother sent him our address and he wrote straight away. I'd rather hear from Gloria, though. Well, I gotta get moving. I never know when to shut up when I start talking to you! Just keep going on and on. Much love, Betty","Good morning, Mom. ","Looks like it's going to be a pretty day. The sun is shining and there's a cool breeze, but I sure miss the birds. You just hear ""people"" noises here, like trucks and cars and kids and dogs, but no birds. We had the nicest trip to San Rafael to see the kids. Northern California (especially the Mount Shasta area) is so pretty now, but guess they really get the snow in the winter, too. We spent one night at the Holiday Inn where Mark works ""room service."" He came knocking on our door about 10 AM and when I opened it he said, ""Excuse me, Lady, but I have to use your bathroom."" I told him that we'd never had ""room service"" like that before and he just laughed. Rich came over Friday after class (PM) and then the boys and Dad went to the stock car races in Petaluma Friday night. We went to see Winnie and Emory (Mutt's cousins) Saturday PM. They're the best people. That Winnie is about 64, weighs about 95 pounds and just bubbles with energy. Emory was head of California State Highway Patrol for quite a few years before he retired. He has diabetes, so has lost some weight since we saw him last, but he says he feels good and just can't eat as much anymore, but says he doesn't miss all the extra stuff he was eating before. Doug is still sleeping. He's ""14"" today and Mark is 19. I'm going to make a small birthday cake for Doug and then will make one for Mark when he gets home at the end of the month. Took Doug to Wards yesterday and he got a new shirt, some ""flared leg trousers and a brown suede belt and he thinks he's the sharpest thing in town. Even came home and polished his shoes so they'd look good and then he sat here all spruced up and waited for Mutt to come home from work. Most of the trousers Doug's size have longer legs and if you shorten them, you lose the ""taper,"" and these had 25.5 inch inseam instead of 28 inch so fit perfect. (Now watch the son of a gun grow and you can't lengthen these either.) Got Doug all set in school. He's going to be taking English, Spanish I, Biology, Algebra, PE, and Frosh Choir. He still says he wants to be a doctor, so I asked him if he planned to sing his patients back to health, since he's taking choir and he said, ""Sure."" School starts September 3. Got him lined up with an orthodontist (only one in town) and ""visited"" him yesterday. Today we have a 1 PM appointment with an accordion teacher. I'm still thinking seriously about seeing if I can find part-time work after school starts. suppose Maria is in Minneapolis now. I would think that would be very interesting. Doris Chabot's daughter is taking a similar course, I guess, in Ashland, Oregon. I think she said Debbie goes to St. Louis, Missouri for four weeks after she finishes in Ashland. Got a letter from our neighbors in Virginia and the Kettlewell's (he's the fellow with no legs) had a 10.5 pound son on August 6. She was due the same time Sadie is. Sure a good thing she didn't go any longer or she'd have had an elephant! Everyone was kidding Pat and Don (Kettlewell) so, and telling them that Pat looked like she was going to have twins, and she really was huge, much bigger than Sadie is. Am sure they're glad it's just one, though, especially with Don and his Buerger's disease. Mom, do you remember the Prottenglier's? They were stationed with us in Albuquerque and then were at Minot when we were at Grand Forks. He was a radio announcer at Minot and they were at a picnic we had in Minot one summer (1959??) (must have been July because I made doll birthday cake for Mona and Maria and brought them to the picnic). We went to their apartment a little while after the picnic. Gloria & Punk (or ""Paul Arthur"" as he's called on radio) had 5 boys. Well, anyway, while we were at Frank's I got Punk's mother's address out of the Minneapolis phone directory and wrote her when we got here. Was a bit shocked when I got her letter and found out they're divorced and Punk married a Minot divorcee with a 13-year-old son in 1962. Gloria has the 5 boys and is still in Billings, Montana where they went from Minot. Punk and Darlene are in Florida and both work for a radio station there. We had lost track of them since they were in Minot. Their oldest boy has a full scholarship to Stanford, so must be a pretty bright boy. He's the same age as Mark. Then they have boys 17, 16, 14, and 12. Anyway, we felt pretty badly when we heard about it. It must be awfully hard on the boys with no father around and also hard for Gloria to raise 5 boys by herself. The boys take turns going to visit their Dad, one boy each summer so that means they see him once every 5 years!!
