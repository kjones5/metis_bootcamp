# WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY)
## Project: Super Street Teams
## WTWY Objectives
Maximize WTWY street team efficacy by using publicly available data to optimize team placement at NYC subway entries and exits.

## Recommendations  
Based on the data published by New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), KPJ Consulting recommends that WTWY street teams are place at a dozen stations grouped by three strategies:
#### 1. Target high-volume locations

 - 34th St - Penn Station
 - Grand Central - 42nd St
 - 34th St - Herald Square
 - Times Square - 42nd St

The first strategy takes advantage of sheer numbers. These stations are centrally located transit hubs and among the highest-trafficked stations in New York City. Street teams will encounter a wide range of both New Yorkers and visitors, contributing to WTWY's goal of increasing awareness and possibly yielding connections with local residents.
