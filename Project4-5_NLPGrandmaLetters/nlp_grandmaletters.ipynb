      "Greetings!!  I've got stuff that should be done, but feel like writing to you instead, so here goes!! First of all, for goodness sake don't worry about Richard's arm! It hasn't bothered him at all since a few minutes after he hurt it. The antics these kids go through every day would sure show up anything that might bother them, and he never favors it, so there's nothing wrong with it. The kids next door have a gymnasium set in the yard and the kids hold onto the bar and swing their feet, so if there were anything wrong with his arm that would surely bother him and it doesn't, so he's 100% O.K. Karen smashed her left hand in the car door Sunday night and thought she may have broken a bone in the back of her hand because it swelled up so fast, but she has good use of it. Her hand is still a little swollen and the back of  her hand and fingers are all purple, but it doesn't seem to bother her a bit. Funny how kids can get banged up and never seems to bother them. We're all waiting to hear the details of the little Monger girls. Gosh, I look at Mark and think \"Two younger than that\"!! That's quite a job for one person. Does Donita crawl yet? Mark walks around everything, but doesn't strike out on his own, as yet. He popped another tooth though, that's 7 now. Karen told Margie the other day that she was in love. Margie said, \"Who are you in love with? and Karen says, \"Hawkins\". Hawkins always says he comes to see Mutt, but I don't think it's Mutt at all, I think it's Maggie he comes to see. Karen's in \"love\" with him because he says \"Jesus loves me\" with her and he read one of her books to her, so she thinks he's really alright. Sadie and Margie went down to the service club to play the piano. Margie's fingers have \"piano itch\", I think.  July 20. Yes, and that was a couple days ago. Got Maria and Mona's announcement yesterday. Holy Moses!! What size would they have been if she'd gone another month!!  We have a set of 8 mos. twins in the nursery, one weighed 3 12 1/2 and the other 3 12 1/4 (Boy and Girl) and just expected to hear Pat's weighed about that. Suppose you've seen them by now. Do they have dark hair or blonde hair?? They aren't in the incubator, either, are they when they're that big? Last night we took the kids down to \"Playland\" and let them ride in the little cars, on an airplane, ponies, etc. and they really enjoyed it. We had driven by it one other night and Karen had been asking to go ever since, so we took them last night. Sadie and Margie didn't want to go, so went to the show at the theater here on the base. Day before yesterday they went to the service club to play the piano, so yesterday they left here early and went to town and bought a book of music. Came home long enough to change clothes and took off for the service club again. Got home about four o'clock and had supper, got dressed again and went to the show. Thursday is their day to howl as Sadie and I have the day off. Think it's been a little hard on them not to be able to go someplace every nite but don't believe it has hurt them any. They go to bed about 11:30 at night and sleep till 9 or 10 every morning, so they're getting plenty of sleep. They really make life interesting though. I'd forgotten how crazy teen-agers can be. I've been trying hard to get most of the housework done before I go to work so they won't go back with the feeling that all they got out of the summer was a lot of work and no play. They've gone swimming at the pool on the base several times, and to a ball game with Hawkins one evening and to the show here on the base and some in town, and they go to town any forenoon they want to, to shop and look around, so hope they don't feel the summer was wasted. They're sure a couple of good kids. Well, my brood is up, so guess I'd better quit. I got up at 6:15 to fix coffee for Mutt, so just stayed up while I was at it. It's 8:15 now. Mark has been fed, dried, and is sleeping again, so that's one down. Now, if I get the other three dressed, fed, and outside, all will be well. Have to go shopping for groceries, too. They've used 71 quarts of milk so far this month. Not bad, what if, heh heh heh, Sadie has put herself on a diet cuz she gained so much at first. No more room. All for this time. Love, Betty, Mutt\n"

      "Your letter came about an hour ago, Mom. The telegram came Sunday. Your letter, telling that Duane was sick, came Monday after the telegram got here. Yes, I broke our engagement, but I never dreamed that Duane would die and add that much more sorrow to Fay's already loaded mind. Mom, I loved Fay very much when I accepted my ring, and had every intention of marrying him then, but I know now that I don't love him. All the while he was gone, I was looking forward to seeing him again, feeling sure that I would still love him and that everything would work out all right for the two of us, but when I came home from the hospital from the nurses meeting and met him at our apartment door, well, it was like meeting a perfect stranger. I don't really think that he has changed at all. He is still the same sweet fellow he was, but Mom, I don't love him! I tried to tell myself, \"You've got to love him, Betty, think of what he's gone through, and how he's looked forward to seeing you again\", but try as I could, I just couldn't tell him that I still loved him as much as before, because somehow I knew I didn't. Then I thought of one thing you've told us time and time again, \"Don't string a man along. If you don't love him, don't tell him you do\". Then I tried to figure out what to do. Should I let it go for awhile? Wait until you've seen him at least several more times so you'll have time to get really acquainted again?? Break it up now?? I decided to wait awhile. Then he was here several times and it just wasn't any different. There just seemed to be that wall between us and I felt that I didn't belong to him. It seemed that I wasn't playing fair by having him come and see me again and again and keeping his hopes sky-high, when I felt that it would never be the real thing with us. He felt too that things just weren't the same now as when he left. We talked it over and then I gave his ring back. No, it wasn't the easiest thing to do after dreaming and planning for almost two years!! It hurt plenty!! But, I still feel that I did the right thing, although I think now that I should have waited until after Christmas with the way things stand now. I had saved all my days off until he came home, so I had three or four accumulated by the time he got here, so I had two Sundays off when he was here. It was a week ago last Saturday that I gave him his ring. I had the next Sunday and Monday off, too, but of course I didn't see him Sunday. Frances went to church Sunday morning, but, well, I supposed might as well tell you why I didn't go with her. It was just because my eyes were so swollen from crying all night and I had a terrific headache. No, I'm not telling you this for sympathy sake, because it was all my own doings and I'm not looking for sympathy. I don't want any of it. All I know is that I don't love him now. I know I did two years ago, and perhaps if I had waited longer before I broke the engagement, then maybe I'd have learned to love him again, but I just don't know for sure. I just can't figure myself out. First there was Art Lien, my high school heartthrob that Daddy disapproved of and I'm glad now that that was broken up. Then there was Leslie. I didn't love him, but he was overseas and I was the girl he dreamed about until he was sure he loved me, but I thought of him more as a good friend. Especially after I met Fay. Then came Fay. Yes, I really believe that I did love him, but I don't now. Ah yes, and Buster! That one I can't figure out. I didn't give him any reason to think of me as any more than a \"sister\". I told him that he could never figure in my life and that I wanted him to understand that and remember it. But what does he do?? Writes me about 7 or 8 letters and several postcards between here and North Dakota and more when he got to Great Falls. But does he remember what I told him, no!!! He writes and practically (although not in the exact words) asks me to marry him. Honest!!! I don't try to string them along!! I know that in one letter home, Frances gave you the impression that I had strung bUster along and that she wished that Fay would come home and straighten me out, and that I ran around so much. But here is one thing she didn't mention or maybe she doesn't realize it, but since she came out here, we've run around twice, or three or four times as much as I did before she came out here. You see, I was afraid she'd get homesick, and when I saw that she might be getting a little homesick I'd suggest a show or something. If I hadn't taken her out or double dated with her she just wouldn't ever have gone anyplace because you know as well as I do that it wouldn't have been safe to let a girl go out alone at night here and besides that she wouldn't have wanted to go out alone. Here's what we usually did. Monday nights we're almost always home. She usually washed clothes or cleaned our house. Tuesday nights Sib and I leave about 6:30 to go to night school and don't get home till 9:30 or 9:45. Frances stays home. Wednesday nights there's a dance downtown at the Municipal Auditorium. She usually liked to go and I enjoy dancing, too, so I can't say that it was always just because she was here. Thursday, night school again and Friday we often double-dated. It was just to a show, lunch after the show and right home. It was always strictly on the level and I always told the fellow about Fay and that we were going to get married when he came home. Sometimes we'd let the kids come up here and we'd make coffee and have lunch here instead of eating uptown at the jammed restaurants, but there was nothing wrong with that and they were always out of here by midnight. They all appreciate so much the fact that we don't drink or smoke and are decent girls and it really means a lot to fellows just to sit and talk, read the funnies, or listen to the radio instead of going into a bar and seeing a girl get tipsy! I never felt that I was untrue to Fay by merely going to a show or drinking a cup of coffee with another fellow and I always told them how much I loved Fay. We never went to the dances with anyone. It was always just Frances and I and if anyone wanted to come and take us we'd just tell them \"no\" and that we'd see them at the dance when we got there. Oftentimes a couple of nice soldiers would walk home with us, but there was nothing wrong with that! I was engaged and I told them that I loved him very much. I'm usually home here by 4:00 and Sib gets here about 5:30 and Frances about 6 now, but she usually got home about 5:00 before. Everything is closed at 5:30, so it was up to me to buy the groceries, pay the light and gas bills, take books back to the library, etc. After running on duty all day, I'd feel so tired that I'd think I couldn't take another step. Then Frances would come home, and if it was Wednesday or Saturday she'd suggest that we go to the dance. Well, that got to be a routine so that it was just taken for granted that we go to the dance every Wednesday and Saturday night. Many and many a time I never told her just how tired I was, because I felt it was my duty to take her a few places, because I was the one who talked her into coming out here, and I feel that it's my place to see to it that she gets around and sees some of the places of interest, and does something to keep her interested and not homesick. When you write back, don't mention it because I don't want her to know that I go just because I feel it's my duty a lot of the time. I enjoy going with her more than I do with any fellows and when she and I go alone we have as much fun and people can't get over the fact that we're sisters and get along as well as we do. But back to the Baukols, I feel so sorry for Mrs. Baukol because I think she is the sweetest little lady and it seems that they have had more than their share of hard knocks in the last few months, and now my breaking off our engagement makes it that much worse. I don't love him, though. I did for the past two years but I'm sure I don't love him now. I had no idea anything was going to happen to Duane or I wouldn't have broken the engagement now, but how was I to know?? I don't go around hurting people deliberately or breaking hearts just for the joy of seeing them crumble!! Because there's no joy in that. I know I've broken hearts, and maybe sometimes it could have been avoided if I had tried hard enough, I just don't know. I didn't want to hurt Fay any more than you wanted to see him hurt. That is why I broke the engagement now. It was either one way or the other. Was I to tell him I loved him when I felt that I didn't and keep him thinking that for several more months while he made more plans for the future and probably gotten to loving me more and then finally tell him that for that period of time I hadn't loved him and was just keeping it up to make him think I loved him??? Or was I to break it now and quit stringing him and possibly regret it later or possibly feel later that I had done right by breaking it now? All I know was that I don't love him now and I couldn't look him in the eye and say, \"I love you\" when I really didn't!! Just what was I to do??? Wellll, I did what I thought was best - I broke our engagement. How was I to know that his only brother was going to die?? A fine Christmas he will have. No girl, no brother!! Yes, I'm not so hard-hearted that I don't feel all that! It's not the best feeling in the world to think that you have spoiled a man's Christmas that he has dreamed of for months while the shells buzzed by and he fought for a girl back him who discovered she didn't love him and he still loved her. What should I do??? Marry him when I'm sure I don't love him, and try to make him happy at least for Christmas?? Mom and Daddy, I'm puzzled, but I really feel that I did the right thing by breaking the engagement when I don't love him. I had no way of knowing that Duane was so near death or I would have waited a while. Your estimation of Fay is absolutely right, he's wonderful, but I don't love him as I used to. Must close this book now, and turn over a new leaf. I hope I never have to come home to you like Esther Ostrem as you mentioned, but please don't feel that I'm a heartbreaker and break people's hearts intentionally. Loving you with all my heart and hoping I won't be bringing any more disappointments your way again. \n",

      "Mom your super-duper letters came, so will answer them right away. First of all I'll start by answering the questions you asked. 1, Mutt will be in the service 1.5 years more, unless such a thing happens that he will be able to buy out before then. (The chances are slim for the latter.) 2, What do I mean when I say we may go to Georgia to live for awhile?? Well, I'm leaving for Texas the 3rd and will arrive there the 4th. We'll be in Texas till the latter part of November and then he is being transferred to Georgia so I'm going along, sooo there is no \"may\" about it now. He has applied for his 58 days and soooo we're keeping our fingers crossed that we'll get that so we can make it to North Dakota for Christmas. 3, Does he intend to stay in the army??? Not any longer than necessary. 4, As a civilian he will work for the airlines (TWA). 5, Will we live in California?? No definite plans made along that line. 6, Is Sib sewing little things?? Yes. So is Grandma!!! (For Sib's!) 7, Has Mutt been overseas?? Yes, he served overseas in Africa, India, Panama, Australia, Tinian Islands, and Japan. He was a Radar Operator on B-29s with the 20th Air Force. My little man is authorized to wear the following ribbons and medals. 1, Air medal with 2 oak leaf clusters. 2, Good conduct ribbon. 3, Victory ribbon. 4, Occupation of Japan ribbon. 5, Southwest Pacific Asiatic Campaign ribbon with three bronze battle stars. 6, European and Middle East Campaign ribbon. 7, Pre-Pearl Harbor ribbon. 8, American Theater of Operations ribbon. 9, Presidential Unit Citation. There!! Now you know that much. Let's see, where was I. Oh yes, question number 9. 9, He is the son of Mr and Mrs Walter H Jones of 401 Maurer Ave, Porterville, California. 10, What church does he belong to?? His folks belong to the \"First Christian Church\", but he has not been much of a church-goer. However, he has been going to church at the base since we were married. But I guess that's enough of the tales of my little man for awhile. Oh, by the way, how did things turn out as to what was planned for Wednesday night, Pat?? Hope it was a big success. I surely would like to see Uncle Sig and Aunt Numidia. I'm going to investigate at the Mission Inn and see if I can find any trace of Malfred. If she's there I should be able to track her down. I've packed Fritzie's typewriter and will try to get both the trunk and that off to her on Saturday. I'm so busy pack, pack, packing and wondering what to do with this and that and the other thing, that I don't know whether I'm coming or going. I was invited to a luncheon and a farewell party for Alberta Graf that works in Post Engineers or at least that's what I was told and it never dawned on me but what that was what it was, then just before lunch was served the kids presented me with a beautiful alloy steel skillet with one of those tight fitting covers, and also a pair of pillow cases from Mary and Bob Harte. Last night Gwenie and Lorna invited Sib and Louis and I over and they had never given Sib and Louis a wedding present, so they gave them (Sib and Louis) a pretty cake plate, and Jonesie and I got the cutest set of creamer and sugar. The sugar container is the gingham clog and there's a hole in the top of his head for the sugar to come out, and the calico cat is the cream pitcher and the cream comes out the mouth and the tail is the handle (drawing). Hmm I'm quite an artist. I've gotta go to bed, though, and get some beauty sleep. Goodness knows I need it! I've been having quite a bit of trouble with my bum ear. It's been aching since a week ago yesterday but I'm under doctor's care so it should clear up pretty soon. The canal is so small that it's kinda hard for them to see much, but it is quite a bit better than it was a week ago, so I guess \"time\" is the medicine. PS Yes, Helen, I'm really gonna write to you, but likely as not it won't be till we get to Texas. I've just got so much to do and so very few hours. (Excuses and more excuses!)\n",

      "My little man is writing to his folks, so I'll be a good kid and write a letter, too. I got in to El Paso at 11:20 AM on Friday and Mutt was there to meet me, He had a buddy of his, Sergeant Kocian, meet us about 5:30 and then we came out here to their apartment. Sergeant and Mrs Kocian left yesterday about 2:00 PM on furlough, so my honey and I have been alone together (hmmm don't know if that's good phrasing or not??) since then. We're living in an apartment in a court and most of the neighbors are GIs and wives, too, and the landlady is very nice. How are the twins and Johnnie?? Helen sent us a cute picture of the twins just before we left Riverside. Oh, forgot to mention about the stuff I expressed home. I sent it collect because it is practically all Frances' stuff and besides that the lady next door (Captain Renick's wife) was going to take care of it for me, so it should be getting there any day now. I sent Fritzie's typewriter to Minot, so she wouldn't have to carry it back from Rugby. I'm glad she's continuing with her college. Louis said to tell her to take his advice and continue through till she had her 4 years completed. She'll get a kick out of that knowing how Louis is about school. We went shopping yesterday and it seemed so different to be actually shopping with my husband, but it's lots of fun, and ooooh how I love my man!!! We've had so much fun together and I'm so thankful that we got married when we did, because otherwise we likely wouldn't have been able to make arrangements for a long time. I sewed his chevrons on a pair of his fatigues today and hemmed the cuffs while he washed the front windows of our apartment. More fun!! I've got some bad news for you, though. By the looks of things now, we can't possibly make it home for Christmas. We'll either be on our way to Georgia or South Carolina about that time. It's all pretty indefinite, but we'll keep you posted on everything, and when to expect us, etc. I took a picture of this court yesterday, so I'll send you one when we get them developed. Yoleta is just 11 miles out of El Paso and is 13 miles from Biggs Field. The country here is pretty full of Mexicans, but there aren't any right near the court here. Oh, forgot about the iceman. He's a Mexican and has a real handlebar mustache. First one like that I've seen for ages!! Guess I'll have to talk my honey into raising one like that. (Oh yes??? I could just see that!) I called Major Miller's folks last night and talked to his mother. Major Miller had asked me if I would call them and tell them that he and Colonel Schultz were going to fly down here to see them sometime in the very near future. She wants us to come out and see them before we leave here, so we'll have to see what we can do about it. Oh, forgot to tell you about our apartment. It's downstairs and is like this (drawing). Guess you can get the general idea of it. It's a cute little place and I could just see it if Mom would get her hands in here!! Oh, yes, there are cupboards above and below the sink and a big mirror above the chest of drawers. Mom, I sent the Riverside Daily Press to your folks and it has the write-up in there about our wedding. I send one to Grandma and one to Helen and Les, and one to Ruthie and Harold, too. Did Big Bird pass his physical at Fort Snelling or did they reject him again?? Oh yes, what subjects are Frankie studying at the U?? Who's rooming at home now?? And who all were at the celebration for you folks on Wednesday?? Oh, yes, has Helen gone to the hospital yet and if so, who is managing the twins??? Guess that takes care of most of the questions I had. I've got lots of letters to write, but I'm going to leave them till tomorrow because then I'll be all alone, and I'd rather enjoy the company of my little honey while he's here. He leaves about 7:30 AM and gets back about 5:30 or so. Mmm he's the sweetest little man in the world and we're so happy together. I wouldn't part with him for anything in the world. Sssshhhh don't tell him, though, or he might get conceited! Nope, I don't worry about that at all! Will sign off for now then and will write again soon. PS When you write, just send it to Mutt because it would be a more definite address than to send it here. G'bye again. PS again, Mutt says to thank you for your letter, Mom, and he will write in a few days.\n",

      "We got your super-duper letter yesterday, Mom, so will answer it this morning. I just sent my little man off for the day. He leaves about 7:30 and is supposed to get home about 5:30 but last night he had to work until 10:00 and didn't get home until 11:00. The fellow he rides to work with came over at 5:30 and said that he wouldn't be home till 7:30 soooo I watched and waited and waited and watched and no Daddy coming!! The poor little guy was soooo tired when he got home, too. He brought the letter from you, Mom, 2 letters to me from him that had been returned from Riverside, some Lux, and 20 packages of Dentyne gum, soooo I've got lots of reading material for today. Oh, yes, and the Riverside Press. I had a busy day yesterday. I really cleaned house here. Washed the rest of the windows, all the woodwork, mopboards, and the floors, also washed clothes, cleaned cupboards, and went shopping in Yoleta with Ann Michaels, a captain's wife who lives next door in the court here. She's from Cleveland, Ohio, and is very nice. She's going into El Paso this afternoon to get some of my hubby's clothes that his mother expressed to him ages ago and they got lost someplace en route and have finally caught up with him. A tractor pulling a hayrack-like-box full of raw cotton just drove by. I was out and inspected a field of cotton here, because it's the first time I've ever seen cotton growing and it's really interesting stuff. I never realized before just how tight the seeds grow right into the cotton balls, and so many seeds to each ball! The raw cotton looks and feels just like raw wool, except for the seeds in the cotton. I think I forgot to tell you that our court is just across the street from the Yoleta High School and the physical education grounds are right next to the street, so I get a ringside seat here all day. The kids flock in from every direction and in the morning sunlight it looks just like a flower garden on parade. They have a big football stadium, too, and there's a game there Friday night, and my homey says if I'm a good girl he will take me to the game, soooo I'm being a very, very good girl. Sure do love that little man of mine, and we're so happy together. I notice more of Daddy's characteristics about him every day, and that's good, good, good, I'll have you know! So the folks around there sorta surprised you, did they?? You mean that Daddy didn't even catch on, like he did when they had the farewell party for you on the farm??? That was pretty good, wasn't it?? If they write it up in the paper, would you send us the paper, please? You see, we have a scrapbook started and it is entitled, \"Keeping up with the Francis E Joneses\". I hope I can keep up with it, because it will be fun to have later on. (There goes another hayrack load of cotton and a big load of baled hay!) Well, guess I'd better go and see if Ann is up, and then wash my breakfast dishes, iron my curtains, make my bed, and then I've got to write to Mother Jones today, too. Oh yes, and Helen and Les, and Ruthie and Harold, and Fritz, and Izzy (at Marchfield), and Gwenie and Lorna and whew!! Guess that's enough for awhile!! Will write again soon. PS Heard on the radio last night that western North Dakota had 5 inches of snow!!\n",

      "I'm lying on my tummy on the bed, so if you can figure this handwriting out, you'll be doing a wonderful job. The cake, preserves, and the pictures arrived the day before yesterday, and oooooh those twinsets are darling. I just wished I could have picked them up and squeezed 'em tight!!! Sure wish we could see them before they get too big. I suppose they'll be walking before we get home, though. Buttttttt we'll be there as soon as we can make it. This old guy by the name of Uncle Sam, sorta has us under his thumb, but I don't mind a bit, because I've never been happier in my life than I have the past month and a half. But I'd better not start in on that again. November 1. Here I am again. I think this will be a book before I get through, but nevertheless here goes. On the twenty-first of October Sergeant Kocian and his wife came back to claim their apartment (we were only using it while they were on furlough) and so we moved into another court. It was very nice, buttttt was $3.50 a day and we were eating out sooooo we couldn't afford that kind of living long. Then the next day when my man had gone to work I proceeded to look for a place to live. I started at 10 AM and walked till 4:30 PM and then came home, because I knew my man would be home about 5:00 sooooo the next day I started again, this time at 9 AM, but I got a taxi and the driver was an ex-GI who knew El Paso pretty well, soooooo we stopped here and there and no luck so finally he said, \"I know a lady who has an apartment and she's a good friend of mine and they're very nice people\". Sooooo he drove up to a house, and even went to the door and introduced the lady and I (by the way, her name is Mrs Jones) and we can get her apartment tomorrow if we want it, but I'm not going to take it now. Well, then we stopped and talked to another lady he knew (Mrs Jenkins about 58 or 60 years old) and she said her sister used to keep roomers, but she had quit some time ago, but that she'd talk to her. SOoooooo here we are at 917 Williams Street, El Paso, Texas at the home of Mr and Mrs Malcomb Johnson (about 55 or 60 years old) and they really are grand people. Both Mr and Mrs Johnson work, so there's no one here all day except on Sunday and then we're all here. Well, back to my story. We moved in here the 24th of October. The 25th I started calling the hospitals to see what was open in the line of jobs and ended up by applying at \"Hotel Dieu\". It's a Catholic hospital and I don't know where it got the name. I'm first floor supervisor and the only RN on the floor. Sister Angeline is there part of the time for, oh, I'd say about 1.5 or 2 hours a day. We have 40 patients and the emergency room is also on first floor, and about 25 different doctors to keep track of. I only get $135 a month with 1 meal and laundry, but I'm off at Saturday noon and all day Sunday and Mutt is off at noon Saturday and all day Sunday, too, so that makes it nice. My hours other days are 7:00 to 3:30. I catch a bus two blocks from here at 6:25 AM and get to the hospital at 6:35 AM, but that's the only bus that runs before 7:00 sooooo I have to leave kinda early. Bus fare is 6 cents each way, so that's not bad, either. I like the work, but it's really a rushed place. There are about 6 or 8 students on first floor in the mornings but we have several American-Mexican nurse's aides who are dandies! I'm beginning to pick up a little Spanish, too. No, not much, but a few words here and there. Last Sunday Mutt and I were loafing around here and it was so quiet and the house was stuffy and the Johnsons were gone, and the front yard needed raking quite badly, so we donned old clothes and out we went and cleaned up the yard and it really looks super. (Ahem!!) Anyway, the Johnsons came home and got such a big kick out of it. I didn't go to work this morning because yesterday afternoon Uncle Sam informed Mutt that they were leaving on a plane at 11 PM today for maneuvers in California and that he is to be sergeant of the guard and that he was also to report at 11:00 this morning to be bonded because he is to be responsible for $6200 cash, 10 other GI's, and all the radar equipment that is going out there for it, sooooo Mrs Johnson called the hospital and told them that Mrs Jones was ill today and would not be able to work. That was at 6 AM this morning. Sooooo we went back to sleep and didn't wake up till 8:30. At 8:45 she knocked on the door and said that she had made toast and coffee for us and that there were preserves and fruit juice on the table and she had also written a note and put it in the bathroom just in case we weren't awake when she left at nine. The note read, \"Betty dear, I have fixed the toast and coffee for you two sweet children. You will find cream in the refrigerator. If you want some sweets I put a jar of jam on the table. Hope you enjoy it all by yourselves. Mrs J. Am sure you had rather be alone this morning, than go out to eat.\" Wasn't that sweet of her? You see, there are no kitchen privileges with the room, so it was all out of the goodness of her heart. They just came home now and stuck their noses in here and Mr Johnson said, \"Anything we can do for the sick and lonely?\" Mrs Johnson had told him about my being \"sick\" this morning and he got quite a kick out of it. We really had to hustle around here, because my man had his OD's in the tailor shop getting them altered and they were to be ready at noon, so he rushed down there to push them along a little, and I packed his clothes and washed and mended some socks for him. (Had to finish mending one on the way to the field this PM.) He took me to the field with him, but I didn't stay to see the plane take off because he had so many things to attend to anyway. Now he will be gone until about the 25th of November. I hope he's at least back here by December 4, because that's his 27th birthday, and he must have a birthday cake with 27 candles!! Birthdays and Christmas have always meant so much at home, and by golly if I can manage to make it the same in our little family, I'm surely going to try anyway. Johnny and Sandy are sitting over on the dresser looking this way, and I sure do wish they'd just step out of the pictures and toddle over here!! I miss those little monkeys, and wish we could get home to see them before they get too big. Of course, I don't think they'll ever be too big, but if they've grown too much, I won't recognize them. I'll bet Big Boss John has changed a lot, too. Golly, if I keep on here, this old gal will be homesick again, and that would never do, because right now she has no one to tell her troubles to and no one's troubles to hear and that's bad! Can't bother the landlord and landlady with little things like that!! How are the kidless coming with their music lessons?? When are they going to start the Faylet orchestra?? With all that music they ought to be able to do something like that, shouldn't they?? How about that, Pat, Sal, and Mugs?? Sure am glad to hear that Frankie is doing so well in school and hope he keeps it up. Always knew there was something other than sawdust in that noggin of his and I\"m glad he found it. Does Fay room with him or do they have separate rooms? Oh yes, and how is Helen now?? I think about her so much with her three little ones and have wondered if she ever started putting some fat on her bones. They really have done wonders with their little family, and hope we can do as well with our family, if we ever have one. So far, no family, but I'd rather not have any while we're bouncing around the country as much as we are. Just think September in California, October and November in Texas, December in South Carolina, and possibly Georgia and then ??? Welllll, it had better be North Dakota for awhile. I hope so anyway. Oh, by the way, by all means give those mitts to Frank. Guess I'll never ever need them again, and there's no use packing them away when they can be used. I got a card addressed to \"Betty Fay Jones\" from the Stennes and Ryan (a wedding congrats) and it was sent to Sib's and Louis' address and they forwarded it on here. Thanks for doing my share at the rummage sale. Doggone it all, I just don't know what I'd do without you, Mom. Here I am clear across the country and still my share of the alumni work is done in North Dakota. Thanks oodles, Mom!! I hope Mrs. Drege gets along okay. She's a pretty heavy lady and it seems that they're always a little slower than a skinny person at recovering from surgery. How's about that, Mom, aren't I right?? (Oh, I'm referring to the skinny people there, Mom!! Ahem!) Well, now it's about time I quit. I'm going to write a special letter to my father tonight. Know the man?? His name is John Fay and he resides in Rugby, North Dakota. Mmmm that's my pop!! Well, one and all, why don't you write to me one of these days again. Yes, I know, you've been doing very well and I've been doing very poorly. Shame on me!! Oh, yes, and will you address them to us at 917 Williams Street, El Paso, Texas. Thanks, and lots and lots and lots of love to you all. PS Will send a bit of Mutt's love, too, but not too much as \"I need my love to keep me warm\".\n",

It was a beautiful, warm, sunny day and we were sitting out on the porch to absorb some of the sunshine, and we suddenly decided to get some exercise, soooo out to the backyard we went to get a rake to rake the front year, and did we work!!!! Mutt did all the raking. I just swept off the sidewalk, so you see who did the work, don't you?? Twas fun nevertheless, and something to do. But back to your letter. It was wonderful, as usual, and had all the kinds of news I yearn to hear about. Such as where you went, with whom, and who had lunch at home when there was a dance in town, etc, etc, etc. Tis almost like being there, because I can picture everything and everyone. Sure would like to drop in and surprise you at school someday! I imagine you'll be through with this term by the time we get home. We hope to be out about July??? No promises, though! Sounds as if you have been pretty busy with parties. Yes, I know what you mean about that French charm, Fritzie, it can't compare with the Irish!!! Yes, I know Quint. I took care of him as a patient once, if I'm not mistaken, and then I remember that he and I rode home from a dance or something one time with someone else and he got mad at me because I wouldn't let him kiss me. Now, Fritzie, don't tell him that, because you might hurt his feelings. I agree with you that he is a very nice young man, though. I took care of Dad, too, once upon a time. He had a \"plantar's wart\" removed from the ball of his foot when I was in surgery and he darn near kicked Doctor Johnson in the snoot when he was working on his foot. He didn't remember it when he woke up from the anesthetic, but it took more than twice the average dose of Sodium Pentothal to put him to sleep. I'm sure he remembers those hospital days. Sib took care of him then. I was in surgery. Hope Curt finishes his medical course. He's got the stuff in that noggin of his if he just puts it to work. I've been in Upham, so I know just how exciting a place it is. We stopped there to get some rice the day we went to \"Poodle's\" wedding. That was Ruthie, Thelma S, and I and then an Axness boy-drove Daddy's car up there for us. It was raining to beat the cars and we got stuck every time we turned a corner, but got home alright with mud, mud, and more mud all over Daddy's car. Excuse me, but my old man is going to beat up on me if I don't quit pretty soon. He wants to take me to the show and he's standing here saying, \"Come on, Betty\", \"Come on, Betty\", \"Betty!!\"  Ahhh I'd better go before he leaves me!! So long for now, more later! 7:30 PM. We're back from the movies. We were going to see \"Blue Skies\" but the line was several blocks long, so we went to see an Alan Ladd picture instead. It was good, too, but I don't remember the name of it. (Tis \"Gang, Inc\" says Mutt!) So Sandy is independent like a certain aunt of hers used to be, is she? Well, now I wonder which aunt that would be?? Oh, yes?? No guessing is necessary in this case. I plead guilty. Say, you know I can't place that Mrs Dixon or Mrs Kirkely but I suppose I would if I saw them again. No doubt they were patients of mine at Good Samaritan Hospital. There is only one hospital here in Sumter and it's pretty well staffed, so I put my name in for private duty for 7 to 3. I put my name in Wednesday afternoon and that night I got a call, so went to work Thursday morning. It was a 62 year old lady who was operated on for a stone in the ureter (the tube connecting the bladder with the kidney) and she really got along super. She had nurses for two days and was feeling so good that we (the other nurse and I) lost our jobs. She was the sweetest little lady and when I left she thanked me for being so good to her and said that if any of her friends got sick she would certainly recommend (you spell it, thanks) me very highly. No, I'm not bragging, but it might come in kind of handy in a strange turn here, just to have a recommendation. Is that big long word spelled right?? Eh headache! Yesterday Mutt went out to the field about 8:30 and I went back to sleep and didn't get up till almost noon. Well, here I was sitting on the bed in my housecoat when my man came home, and at noon at that! Then he started to tease me and he said, \"Gee, I thought you'd have the room all cleaned up when I got home.\" I said, \"Gee, I didn't think you'd be home till 3:30 or later.\" Soooo he says, \"Well, I'm going to go out on the porch and sit in the sun and pretty soon I'll come in and will pretend I'm just coming home from work and you'll have the room all cleaned.\" Soooo he went out on the porch and pretty soon I called him and said he could come home now. Soooo he came home again and the room was all cleaned!!!! The was just before we raked the yard. Right now he's in bed serenading me with harmonica music. He really makes that harmonica hum. Soooo my Fritzie is worried about being almost 22 and still single. Well, Fritzie, take it from one who knows, just wait till you're sure, because by golly, somehow you just know it when it hits you. No, I can't explain it, but you'll know, by golly, when it does. Right now it's \"Brahm's Lullaby\" coming from the harmonica. Tis pretty, too. Mutt has a nice voice, too, so I'm real anxious to get him singing with \"us'n co\". Fritzie, I'm gonna sign off again. Haven't written much of anything, but as yet there's no news. Might be later on, if we get to move into a five room furnished house that we have our eyes on. We should know about it in about a week for sure. (Now it's \"Taps\" from the harmonica.) Must be bedtime. But back to the house. We will even have a telephone of our own so you can call us anytime then. We still hope to make a phone call home, but it won't be till after payday (January 31) now. We'll let you know in advance. That's all for this time and for heavens sakes don't get lost in those snowbanks!!! PS Telephone just rang. I go to work Tuesday with a Mr Kennedy for surgery. PS Please note, this time I answered soon. Expect same in return. Liz. \n",

      "I really hit the jackpot yesterday!! Got a letter from Mom and Fritzie and then one of the neighbors came and told me there was a package and a couple letters for me at the little grocery store here near the housing, soooo while I shined my shoes Mutt drove down and got them. Twas the package from home that you sent and birthday cards from Sadie and the folks. Thanks just oodles!! Was especially glad to see those pink articles because something has happened to the elastic in the rest of mine. They used to look like this (drawing) and now they look like this (drawing)!!! Can't figure it out!! The nylons are always welcome! I'll wear them when I can \"dress up\" again. (Gee, won't it be wonderful when I can get into a real dress again??) I didn't try the egg poacher this morning but Azalea (from next door) uses one all the time for little Buddy's vegetables, so I know it will really be a handy little gadget later on. We had real raspberry jam on our toast this morning. Good stuff, too, by golly!! Tasted like fresh raspberries! The dishcloth, I've decided, should be Mutt's to try out first, but so far I haven't convinced him of that. Oh, yes, and baby Jones' little wrapper is so soft! Wish \"it\" would hurry up and get here so I could try some of these things on \"it\". Gonna take that little while dress (trimmed in blue) that you made, Mom, to the hospital with me when I go, because it's just the thing for our wee one to wear home. It will be too hot for anything flannel yet, and probably too hot for a shirt, but we'll see about the shirt when the time comes. I had an X-ray on Thursday and guess what!! I'm gonna have a baby!! The poor little thing is really doubled up in there, but the X-ray shows no evidence of a flat pelvis soooo that's good. It hasn't dropped yet, either, so wouldn't be surprised if I was a week or two late. Anytime is alright with me, though. The sooner the better!! Judging from the x-ray, I'd say that it won't be more than about a 6 pound baby, unless it grows a lot in the next two weeks, and frankly I'd just as soon it stayed around six pounds. I only gained half pound last week, but that was because the doctor had me on a diet. The week before that I gained 3.5 pounds and the previous week 2.5 pounds so if I had kept that up I'd have been pretty big by September 22. I weight 130.75 pounds now, a gain of 18.75 pounds, and I'm not to gain more than 20 so I don't have much to go on. However, I did \"fall off the wagon\" last night and eat one of Margie's brownies she sent, because after all, they were a birthday present and birthdays only come once a year and besides that, they were darn good!! Thanks, Muggsie!! Had a busy day yesterday. Was up at 5:30 so my darling could have breakfast before he left (he has to be at the field at 6:30 now), and then I defrosted my refrigerator, washed dishes, put up the curtains on the windows on the doors (that's all of them up now!), cleaned out some dresser and cupboard drawers, and then by the time I had everything picked up and my bed made and stuff twas time to start dinner. After I had finished the dinner dishes I flopped on the bed for about an hour to rest my big feet. They've been swelling a lot, but it's just due to the cement floors, because I have a urinalysis every week, so I know that's okay. Anyway, I ironed from 2:30 till 5:00. Not that I had so much to iron, but you know my speed!! Mutt had to stand inspection this morning and also a big parade, so I pressed his uniform yesterday and he polished his brass and his shoes and he had a haircut yesterday, so he really looked sharp as a tack this morning. Last night we went to the show to celebrate our first anniversary. It was \"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\" and it was very good. It's in technicolor and is a musical. Hope you get to see it if it comes to Rugby. Just think we've been married a whole year!! And what a wonderful year it has been. I never knew then that it was possible to love anyone as much as I love Mutt or to have anyone mean as much to one as he does to me. A year ago now we were just boarding the bus at Riverside to go to Porterville to see his folks and let me tell you I was one scared chicken!! I was so afraid they wouldn't like me, but I hadn't been there more than a little while before I knew everything was all right. It doesn't seem like it's been a whole year ago, though. But guess I'd better quit reminiscing here. We're going to Sumter (10 miles) today to get our laundry, etc, so suppose I'd better get my mitts on the broom and start sweeping so I'll have that done before noon. Haven't done my dishes as yet, either, and tis 9 bells. Ann was going to try to get an appointment at the beauty shop for me for this afternoon so I can get a feather-cut. This damp weather keeps my hair looking like a bush, so I'm gonna get it cut and it will probably be easier to take care of after our infantees arrives, too. How is Sadie's toe after the last trip to Minot? Hope it's on the mend in time for school too tart. Well, reckon I'd better sign off, but before I do, there's one most important thing to discuss. You asked if we'd have room for you, Mom, if you came to stay with us during the crucial moments!! Boy, we'd find room for the whole family if you wanted to come, even if we had to hang on hooks by turns to keep out of each other's way!!! Never fear!! Anytime any of you want to come and see us, we'll sure find room someplace, so don't worry about that. We've got plenty of bedding, too, and even some extra plates, so you won't have to worry about a thing. Just think!! 16 more days!!! Wheeee! I'm gonna be a mamma and Mutt Boy is gonna be a poppa and Helen is gonna be an aunt and Lester's gonna be an uncle and Johnnie, Sandra, and Jimmy are gonna have a cousin and all for the first time for each of us!!! Gonna quit this nonsense and get to work!! I get started here and could rattle on and on all day to you folks, but gotta get a move on. It's 9:30 now. Thanks again for everything. Oh, almost forgot to thank you for Baby Jones' garters!! Thanks oodles!! \n",

      "Well, we dood it!!! Got the cutest little dark haired, blue eyed girl I ever laid eyes on!! She looks just like her Daddy, but she's as lazy as her mother. Mutt sent you a telegram right after she arrived, so by now you already know all about her anyway. I started \"aching\" about 10:00 Thursday night and didn't tell Mutt, because I wanted him to get a little sleep while he could, and then I woke him up about 1:00 and asked him if he'd like to take me for a little ride. He thought it was breakfast time and that I was just teasing him, but then he looked at the clock and boy! He was out of that bed in two seconds flat!! We got here about 2:20 AM and Karen came into the world at 10:36 AM Friday morning. So my labor wasn't too long for a first one, but believe me, long enough to do me for awhile. Time out! Had to go to the desk and fill my pen. They really get you \"up and out\" here in a hurry after delivery. I was up at 11:00 Saturday morning and went to the bathroom and have been up and down ever since. After your first 24 hours you're on your own. You go to the bathroom and give yourself a sponge bath every morning and take care of yourself completely except for taking your temperature and serving trays. I think it's a good policy, though, because my stitches have bothered me very little and I don't feel weak at all. Ahhhh!! Shore'n' tis the Irish in me!!! \"We'll\" be going home Friday and my Daddy will probably be glad, because he says it's mighty lonesome there all by himself. Our hospital and doctor bill is only 90 cents a day, so it will cost us about $7.20! Imagine the difference between that and what it would have cost us in a civilian hospital. We have good meals, too. It's 9:00 AM now, and I suppose little Karen will be in to see her Mama pretty soon and I hope she's hungry because I'm practically floating away here. She's so soft and sweet and it just doesn't seem possible that she's really ours. I'm anxious to dress her up. She's going to wear that dress that you made, Mom, and a sweater and bootie set her Daddy got for her. She is the sweetest little thing I ever saw!! I wish you could see her, because she really is a honey. Okay, so maybe I am a little prejudiced! I got weighed yesterday and weighed 120 pounds and this morning I weigh 118.5, so I came down pretty well from my 134.75 pounds I weighed last Thursday. Well, I'd better sign off and get set for my baby. Gee, that sounds funny, doesn't it?? \"My baby.\" Ahhhh! Tis really wonderful, though, to have one of your own, isn't it, Mom?? This is all for now.\n",

      "This is going to be a joint letter because I'd never get separate thank-you written at the rate I'm doing now. First of all, Happy New Year!! It's 8:15 AM and Karen is eating and Daddy has gone to work so all is quiet. Karen had her pablum and formula at 8:00 last night and then slept till 10 minutes to eight this morning, so that's pretty good. I think she's catching cold, though, because she's been coughing and sneezing ever since she woke up this morning. Another 3 weeks and she starts getting her immunization shots. Poor little lamb!! I'll be glad, though, because there's so much whooping cough around here. Now for the Christmas package!! It was wonderful!! Daddy did the honors and opened them (yours and Helen's batch came Saturday a week ago) and Karen and I watched him. She was kinda sleepy and didn't give her pink elephant a second glance, but the next day I tied ribbon across her crib with the elephant on it, and boy does she have a time with it now!! She really wears herself out hitting it and then squealing to beat the cars when it swings back and forth and rattles. We held the bank up for her and she was so sleepy she scarcely saw it, but when Mutt shoot it she was ready to grab it when she heard the noise. The crib spread is beautiful and much too nice to put on her crib right now because we have a coal heater and the whole house is covered in soot. Frank and Pat, Karen says to thank you for her cup and it won't be long before she can use it. The booties came in handy as she has outgrown most of the others, all except for one pair I think. She sure has long feet for such a little squirt. She sure doesn't get that from her Daddy with his 6.5 or 7 shoe!! The hammered trays are lovely! Mutt explained to me just how they're made, as he used to make them when he was in grammar school. We really needed ash trays, too, because we'd broken 3 of them and had just one left, so now with his \"Mutt\" ash tray and the 3 he got from Helen's triplets we're doing pretty good. Daddy, we got a stroller for Karen with the money order you sent. Thanks a million. I propped her up in it Christmas morning for a little while and she had a big time. Her neck is still a wee bit too wobbly to leave her in there very long, but another month she should really make good use of it! I hear someone squealing and can hear the elephant rattle every once in a while, so guess pee-wee Jones is through with her bottle. I took her to the clinic last Monday and she weighs 12 pounds 2 ounces now and is doing fine, he says. I had her all dressed up in the blue dress we gave her for Christmas, the blue shoes she got from Aunt Helen Drege, white anklets, and the blue sweater and cap Mom crocheted for her and boy those blue eyes just looked bluer than ever. Captain Burnette looked at her and she grinned at him so cute and he said, \"My, but she's a pretty baby!\" (Ahem!! Rave on, proud mother, rave on!!!) He said I could start her on vegetables anytime now if she'd take them, but she seems satisfied now with a tablespoonful of pablum twice a day and 6.4 ounces of milk every 4 hours, so I'll wait a little while with the vegetables. Did I tell you that all the apartments got apartment-size ranges for Christmas?? Of course, the government owns them, but are they ever wonderful to cook on compared to the 2-burner hot plates we had. Didn't get it hooked up till December 31, so had fried chicken for Christmas dinner. Twas good anyway. Mutt really likes that travel kit. Guess he's ready to go anytime, now that he's got that to take with him. They really have everything in them, don't they? As to maneuvers, Mutt doesn't have to go on any this time. Sure was glad they called them off before Christmas. Well, thanks for everything and especially the jam preserves and pickles!! Mmmm were they good!! We're not much for pickles but boy!! Those bread and butter pickles are just about gone now and no one but the two of us has been eating them, so that proves how we liked them. Yes, Pat, I can wear those hose. They're so sheer that they don't look too dark. Oh, yes, and the apron is just \"what the doctor ordered\" so to speak. Now let's see, what have I missed??? Well, if I missed anything it's just because I've got a big batch of diapers staring me in the face, so better get at them. Thanks oodles for everything and hope you have a very Happy New Year and the best of everything in 1948. PS Sadie, how about a picture of you and that new formal? We'd like to see you in your first formal, and can't come up there right now, so how about a picture of you in it and a letter telling us all about what color it is, etc. PPS Margie, just saw this map of the US in the Sumter paper and thought you might be able to use it for current events. Looks like North Dakota is the safest place in the country by the map.\n",

      "Tis gonna be a short note, but nevertheless we'll call it a letter. Got your letter yesterday, Pop, and was really surprised!! (Pleasantly surprised, that is!) It's 8:30 and I've got lots of work that should be done, but won't be. Yesterday was my day off and I washed clothes. When I came home from work Thursday night, Mutt had scrubbed and waxed the living room and kitchen floors so I wouldn't have to do it on my day off. Wasn't that wonderful!! I really appreciated it because there are lots of other things that I need to do and it sure did help to have the floors all fixed up so shiny. I've been working in the nursery from 3 to 11 and like it fine. Have 18 babies (3 incubator) and really enjoy it, but am going on 3 to 11 private duty next week because it pays $2 a day more which means we can take a furlough that much sooner. Plan to be in North Dakota for your anniversary. There's a GI here from Grand Forks who is going to take a furlough at the same time and that way he and Mutt can take turns driving and we won't have to spend as much time traveling. We went to the show last night. It was \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" and was really wonderful. 3 hours long, but it didn't seem that long. Karen is crying. Guess I'd better feed her and put her to bed for her AM nap. Hi folks. Gonna see you soon. Mamma stood me on the table and I was naughty and wet on her stationery. See the drop? I have no manners. Love, Karen. PS She's not just fooling either! She did exactly that!!\n",

      "Well, here I am, late again!! Hope you had a happy anniversary anyway, even if my greetings are a week late. We've been watching and waiting for word from Pat. What happened to her? Or did she change her mind about coming? We've got a clothes closet and a chest of drawers standing empty now waiting for somebody to put something in them. Suppose Fritzie is home now, too, isn't she? What's she going to do this summer? Had to take time off to put my daughter to sleep for her morning nap. She's been out in the yard in her stroller since 7:00 this morning and has really had a time of it. Two of the little neighbor boys were fighting over her (and at her young age!! My, my!). Kemp said she was his baby, and Billy came over and swatted him a good one and sat him down on the ground and said, \"No! Dat my baby!\" Kemp was 2 in March and Billy is almost 3. Billy has a little sister about a month younger than Karen, but Kemp doesn't have any little sister. He went home and told his Mamma, though, that he wanted one. Don't know if he will get it or not. Billy is kind of a rough little character and bites all the kids in the neighborhood so I have to watch him pretty close, but Kemp sits on the ground beside her stroller and chatters away to her and keeps all the dogs, cats, etc away from her. He's quite the bodyguard. It's nice and cool here today, but goodness only knows what the afternoon will bring. Haven't done anything of importance lately, so guess there's not much news. Had a nice long letter from Helen, but haven't answered it yet. Donaheys moved a week ago yesterday so we've gotten things pretty well straightened out again. Working hours have changed too from 8 to 5 to 7 to 4, so we've got to get up an hour earlier, but it gives us more time together because Mutt is usually home by 4:15 and we eat about 5 and have a nice long evening. The evenings are wonderful now. Nice and cool and no bugs as yet. Got the Tribune yesterday and see where Sib made it in time for graduation. Maybe I'll make it next year. Am glad I came back when I did, though, because it gave me time to get stuff put away a little before Mutt came home. Guess they had quite a time on maneuvers. Lived on \"K\" rations part of the time, slept in an old plane hangar that used to belong to the city, and had to go into town to take a bath. No water to wash out clothes, etc etc etc, and then he was on 24-hour call all the time they were there, so guess it was no pleasure trip. One consolation, though, was that they didn't charge Mutt with the furlough time he took to stop by California for the car. Guess they figured they owed him that for calling him back off the furlough before. Well, gotta get started here. Haven't even made my bed yet. Oh, yes, saw Catherine Thomas' name listed in the marriage license applications. Is that George Thomas' oldest girl?? Doesn't seem possible that she is old enough to marry. Who is that Anderson boy she married?? Once again I'll stop. All for now. PS Happy anniversary for June 1949!! There, I'm early with that one!!\n",

      "Gee, won't be long I can say that, will it, so I'll use it while I can. I just told Karen to sit real still and eat her toast so I could write a note to Pat, so she is sitting here going up and down the scale with \"Pa, Pa, Pa, Pa\" and an occasional \"doot, doot\" with it. I dreamed about you last night. You were a little girl 4 years old dressed in a white dotted Swiss dress and had your hair bobbed short and parted on the left side with a silver barrette on the right side and you were standing up beside a big ironing board ironing. You were the cutest darn thing and had the rosiest cheeks, but I was looking at you and wondering how your head and shoulders could be above that big ironing board, and I'd stoop down to see if your feet were on the floor and they were. Then by the time I got up again, your head and shoulders were still above the ironing board. I asked you how a little girl like you could keep your head and shoulders above the ironing board with your feet still on the floor and all you said was, \"Ask Ada.\" Then I woke up! Crazy?? Nope! Just a crazy dream, but it was so real and you were so darned cute! Now for army gossip! Mutt will be going on maneuvers December 15 over by Los Angeles, but will get home weekends. I don't know how long that will last. Oh, yes, and Warrant Officer promotions are put off again till November 26, so they've prolonged that agony another couple weeks. The list was supposed to be out July 15, and they keep delaying it a couple weeks longer all the time, so Mutt is still in \"suspenders.\" I know you must be rushing around like mad, getting ready for your wedding day. Mutt says I can go home if I want to, but I know that would mean no Christmas for anybody from us, and it would be quite a trip to make alone with Karen, and besides I'd rather wait till Mutt can go, too, which may mean another year or so. Would really like to be there, but guess you'll have to write and tell me about it. What are your plans? Do you plan to live with Mongers or get an apartment? Where are you going on your honeymoon? Is your wedding going to be formal? Can I get anything here you might need? Oh, I'm so curious I'm just about busting! What are you going to wear for your honeymoon going-away clothes? Want to thank Donnie for the magazine rack. That sure saves a lot of loose papers from cluttering up the place. It's a pretty one, too. Karen's rocking chair isn't here, yet, but the papers with the magazine rack said the other papers would be with the rest of our order, so it should be here any day now. We're going to go over to the Launderette on the base at noon today to do our laundry, so we're having chili for dinner. They've got 10 machines over there, so I shouldn't have any trouble getting a few of them. Still haven't finished the ironing I had when you were here, but have the bathroom curtains up and also the flowered curtain over the shelves and the shelves straightened up so the bathroom looks real nice. Gotta start on Fibber McGee's closet again but will wait till after I get Christmas stuff out of the way. I called Sib yesterday and she said Louis is back with Duane. She said there was more to the story than that, but that she'd tell me when she saw me. Laura Thompson (last name now?) was over to see Sib and is expecting her first baby in three weeks. She married her boss about 4 years ago and he was a widower with a son about 5 or 6 years old then. We're going over to see her someday. She lives in San Bernardino just 4 blocks from the bus depot, so we know where to find her now. Well, Pat, I know you're busy and I'm just rattling on anyway, so I'll quit. Best wishes to you for the future and give Donnie my congratulations. \n",

      "Your letter about Uncle Bern got here day before yesterday via Porterville, but have not sent a card for fear he wouldn't be there to get it. I figured he would have had surgery by now because it took the letter so long to get here and hated to send a card not knowing what the outcome was. I'm going to call Uncle Gus this afternoon (if I can locate him) and see if he has heard. I've had Karen't coat and cap at the cleaners and we've been having sand storms, so couldn't get to a phone to call him. It looks clear today, though, so will go up and call him as soon as Mutt gets home from inspection and parade, which should be before noon. Uncle Gus won't be in his office after noon and I don't know his new address so will have to catch him before he leaves the office. Sure hope Uncle Bern makes the grade. What is Mrs Mitzel's trouble? Mutt brought Karen't rocking chair home with him when he came for supper last night and you should have seen her! I had started to feed her and when she saw the rocking chair she went back and forth in her high chair and kept saying, \"Wa-bye, wa-bye\" and then wanted to get right in it, so we put her in it and she just more than \"wa-byed\". It's a wicker rocker painted cream with the edges dark brown and has a bright-flowered upholstered seat. Matter of fact, she's in it again now with her baby and her pillow. Hasn't even gotten her clothes on yet, and could scarcely take time to eat any breakfast. Maybe she will get hungry again after the first novelty of it all wears off. Had the nicest surprise night before last!! It was 8:30 and I had just taken Karen't coveralls off and put dry pants on her to put her to bed, when there was a knock at the door. I knew it wasn't Mutt at that time of the night, so opened the inside door and looked through the screen and lo and behold!! There stood Sib, Louis, and Louis Gene, Jay Kirkeide, and Palmer Johnson! Boy, it was good to see somebody from home and so nice of them to bother to look us up. I really did appreciate it. Course as things always, happen, I had just taken the garbage out just before they came and it was windy, so my hair was standing on end, Karen just had her shirt, diapers, anklets, and socks on, I'd washed clothes and had them on the davenport, had done some ironing while supper cooked so the ironing board was still up; had washed the sheet and towel that I use to cover the footlockers I use for a radio stand, so those ugly green things stuck out like sore toes. I had the rest of the house all clean, dishes washed, floors clean, and Karen't toys picked up, so that helped some. We had a good time chatting anyway and I forgot what I looked like or what my living room looked like and just enjoyed our visit amidst it all. I had baked a cake the day before and it had kind of dried out, but they ate it anyway. Mutt teased me about it and said that those fellows would probably go back to North Dakota and tell folks that they sure felt sorry for Mutt Jones to have to eat cake like that. Crazy kid!! It was the night for monthly inventory at the Px, so Mutt was a little late getting home. When they take inventory for the army it's really inventory!! Have to even list their cigarettes by the number of cigarettes, not by the number of packs or cartons, and an officer has to check with them. I picked a bouquet of cosmos out of our yard yesterday. Can you do that in North Dakota now. I was telling Jay that Grandma Jones had such beautiful roses in bloom in their front yard now and he laughed and said that he and Palmer picked a couple white roses in Long Beach, too. Judging from the way he laughed, I'd say that they were probably two-legged roses! Well, I've got to get dressed and get at the house so it won't look too rough when \"Papa Comes Marching Home Again, Hurrah, Hurrah\". Can just imagine the way everybody is rushing around there now with everything going on. Oh, by the way, Pat, Dad Jones said to tell you, you should have set your wedding for December 2 because that's his birthday and that's a good, good day. By golly, Mutt's is the 4th, too. Karen and I have been putting pennies, nickels, and dimes in her bank so we'd have something to surprise her Daddy with, don't know what it will be yet. Gotta quit again. PS Am feeling very fine!! Very fine, indeed!\n",

      "All is quiet on the Jones front, as yet!! Mutt is at March Field again tonight and Karen is sleeping and Pete and Don't Repeat are battling as usual. These babies of mine almost have me laid up these past couple days. Karen has all four eye teeth swollen good and fusses day and night and the twins are trying their darnedest to climb over my ribs, so between the three of them they've got me winded good. I think I've added a good 2 or 3 inches or more to my bay window since you left. If I get much bigger, I'll bust!! That's right, isn't it, Daddy?? B-u-s-t, bust!! Marie and Dolly Gibbs (and Warren and Robert-Warren Gibbs) were down over the weekend because Marie came after a '49 Buick Sedanette for her Dad. ($2800-plus.) Dolly and Warren went back Saturday morning, but Marie stayed till about 4 PM Monday. She went to Sears and got a crib and mattress for us, too. I asked her not to, but she did it anyway. Hope you folks don't feel bad about it because I talked you out of it. We ordered a 56-piece layette from Monkey Ward with part of the money you left here, and plan to hang onto the rest to see what we need later on for \"them\". The crib is supposed to be delivered tomorrow and the layette about Friday. The lady that sold us the crib and mattress asked what color we wanted the mattress in pink or blue and Mutt replied, \"Blue, of course. I can dream can't I?\" She got quite a laugh out of that. How's your trip?? When do I start sending your letters to Uncle Leo's?? I've got a lot of little things to sew before the day, so won't promise too many letters between now and then. I got some planned and am making some extra washcloths and dish towels out of that. They dry faster than the knit ones do. Also have yet to put that blue ribbon on the shawl. Ruthie's daughter weighed 7 pounds 4.5 ounces, and they named her Joan Louise. Born on George Washington's birthday. Maybe ours will be just as famous and get here on Gunda Fay's birthday. Wouldn't that make them famous?? Gonna go to sleep while Karen's sleeping. Give Grammie our love. Oh, yes, and Karen still asks for \"Wank\"!! Wow! How he affects these young women!! Thursday noon. Crib and mattress just got here. Had a letter from Sib, everything okay there.\n",

      "Just finished my ironing so will take a few minutes off (and a few pounds off my feet) and write you a line to give you the latest dope. Went to the doctor Monday and I now tip the scale at 129.75 pounds, a gain of 25 pounds, 5 since you left. Everything I eat puts on a pound or two and believe me I feel it now. My poor abdomen is stretched till it's got purple streaks on it and my darned kids won't let me sit, lie, or even stand comfortably now. Heaven help me if I put on any more weight because I have to turn sideways now to reach the bottom of the kitchen sink to wash dishes!! Frank would sure snort if he saw me now! Had a funny spell last weekend, but don't know what it was. It started about noon Saturday and I had blurred vision, ringing in my ears, and dizzy as a loon, but not so bad that I couldn't get around. Sunday morning it was worse and every time I'd start to get up, everything would spin and go black, so I spent all day in bed. Monday morning I was still rather lit, but able to stand up and walk without staggering, so kept my appointment at the clinic. My blood pressure and urinalysis were okay and the doctor said it was just from pressure on nerves because of the twins and the only thing to do was to rest as much as possible and stay out of crowds, off buses, etc and not to go anyplace alone soooo that was that. I was down most of Monday afternoon, but got up and washed clothes Tuesday and ironed today and still feel pretty pert. Thought we were going into the production business early this morning because I had some pretty good back pains and low abdominal pains from about 1:30 or 2:00 AM till 6 AM, but they quit entirely again, and haven't even had a twinge since, so guess it was all a false alarm. The doctor at the hospital says \"they\" will arrive about the 1st of April, so still have a couple weeks to go. We're still looking for names, so if you have any suggestions, send them along One girl will be Frances Maudeen and another one might happen along, so how about a suggestion. Also have Rodney LeRoy for the boy, but might need another boy's name. We're stumped as to names, so ask Uncle Leo and Aunt Helen, maybe they can help us out if you can't. Oh, forgot to tell you, Daddy, that when the Joneses were going back to Porterville from Cayucos they had trouble with the jeep, so stopped to get it fixed and while they were there, old Dad Stemper fell into a grease pit and came out grease from head to foot. Didn't get hurt, but it tickled him and Dad Jones both after that fall in Cayucos, too. Those two sure are a team, aren't they? Called Dorothy Beck Byergo the other day (last week) and we talked for about half an hour or so and she called me yesterday and we gabbed some more. I wrote to Sib and asked them to come down this weekend and also asked her to call Laura Thompson and see if she could come Sunday and Dorothy and her husband are coming over, so we can really have a gay time if we all get together. I saw Laura in 1945 but haven't seen Dorothy since 1940 and she hasn't seen either Sib or Laura since 1939, so we'll have a lot to talk about. Dorothy is expecting the 1st of May, so we're in the same boat. Got your letter from Grammie's and was so glad to hear that she is feeling so good. I remember little \"Jo-Mo\". Gee, he's about 5 years old now. Donahey left on emergency furlough last Thursday because his mother was ill, but she passed away Friday and he didn't get home there till Monday afternoon. She had 6 or 7 spells before and has been unable to talk since 1946, and the doctor said if she had come out of this one she would have been blind, too. She was 65 years old. The boys in the squadron took up a collection for a wreath for her funeral and they wired that as soon as they got the address. Irene and Dayle Junior didn't go because he was flying on government planes and only GIs can catch hops like that. Rumors of transfer to Orlando Field, Florida by April 1 are red hot now. We aren't worried, though, because they can't move Mutt anyway for a while. Colonel Emory was making a list of the men here whose wives were pregnant and beside Jones' name he put a big two. One of the girls upstairs here is about 4 months pregnant, so I guess we'll both be staying here. They won't send the whole squadron anyway, just a cadre of men. Mutt went to look at the quarters that were being vacated at the field and guess it was a beauty!! The wallpaper was pulling off in strips and it was absolutely overrun with cockroaches. It was on such a steep hill that you couldn't get up and down it without a car, and there was no paint on the outside of the building at all, so he just told them \"No, thanks, we'd stay where we were awhile\". Well, tis 5:25 now and time to start supper for Miss Karen. We're having liver tonight, so guess I'll have liver and lettuce. Good, huh?? Karen has to have her potatoes and vegetables, though so she can get as fat as Mommie. Say, Mom, you said Daddy had been doing most of the letter writing. Where's he sending them all?? Tell him to get mixed up and send one this way. Our address is still 2980 Rosecrans Street, and I don't think we've gotten our two letters from him yet this year!! Our love to Aunt Helen and Uncle Leo. Is big bud home now?? PS Karen's hollering, \"Mommy. Eats.\"\n",

      "It's visiting hours and I don't got no company, so I'll visit with you awhile. We sure did it this time, didn't we? I had Rodney in here at 6 AM and Richard at 10 AM and by golly I can't tell them apart except that Rodney is a little smaller. He eats better than Richard does, though, so it won't take him long to catch up with his big brother. Rodney is the smallest, but he is also the oldest, by 3 minutes. Monday, 1 PM. Dorothy Beck and her husband surprised me yesterday, so I didn't get this finished. They live about 4 blocks from the hospital and Bob had Sunday off, so they came over to see me. They're expecting the stork the first week in May, so she was real interested in this place. Mutt went to March Field Saturday afternoon to find a place for us to move to and find out definitely if his transfer went through. He said he'd be back by 7 tonight, so tonight I should get some company and also some news of some sort. Most of the women go home on their 4th day but I don't know if having two babies will make any difference or not. They're both pretty sturdy looking fellows. I don't know who they look like, though. Both have dark hair, noses like their Daddy's, and light eyebrows and eyelashes like their mamma. Hmm, maybe they'll be redheads someday. I'd have sworn that one of them had a wrinkled forehead like yours and mine, the first time I saw him, but they haven't cried enough for me to see any wrinkles since then, so don't know if the wrinkles are still there or not. I don't believe Grandma has gotten to see the cherubs yet, because they won't show them to anyone except the father and he can only see them once, so that's rough. Oh, well, wait'll I get them home then Grandma can spoil one and that proud papa can spoil the other one. Am so anxious to see how Karen reacts to them. I feel pretty chipper these days. Was in bed till Sunday morning and then got up, took a shower, walked to the nursery and got one son to feed and then get up and down as I please, so that's not so bad for 24 hours after having twins, is it? Got some pretty sore stitches today, though, so am spending a little more time being lazy. Well, Pop, just thought I'd write the first letter to you, so here it is.\n",

      "Mom came up to see me last night and brought the most beautiful bouquet of flowers with a card that said \"from Daddy and the family at home\". Thank you a million!! It's by far the prettiest bouquet here and everyone who walks by, comments on them. There are some red flowers (look like delphiniums), purple iris, pink carnations, and white sweet peas. Real, real pretty!! Mutt didn't get back last night, so still no news of whether or not his transfer went through. Doctor Harris was in to see me this morning and says I can go home Friday, if the twins both weigh over 5 pounds, which no doubt they will, and if they get them circumcised Thursday. They prefer to do that before they ever leave the hospital because there is less chance of infection when they're small and they heal up quicker, too. Poor little fellows! Doctor Harris was with Doctor Taylor when the twins were born and asked if I wanted boys or girls. I told him we wanted one boy at least and he says, \"Well, I've got twin boys of my own, so I'll stick around and see that you get twin boys.\" By golly, he did, too. I think I can tell them apart now. Richard has a rounder face and Rodney's is thinner and his chin is a little more pointed. That is, I think. I wouldn't swear to it, though. Maybe by Friday I'll be more sure of who's who. They look sweeter every day, to their mama anyway. Well, time to go get Richard, no it's Rodney this time, and feed him.\n",

      "While Karen's egg boils I'll steal 5 minutes and write to you. Gosh, do I miss you!! It's so lonesome without you and Karen and I don't have anyone to talk to. Yesterday morning when Karen woke up the first thing she said was, \"Ma-mo?\" I told her you went bye-bye. She sat on her potty and kept saying, \"Wha-Ma-mo?\" And I'll bet she asked me that 50 times. Then she said, \"Ma-mo back soon?\" I told her that you had gone to North Dakota and she pipes up, \"Gandad, Wank?\" I told her that you had to go home on the train to take care of Gandad and Wank, so now every time the train whistles she comes running in to me and says, \"Ma-mo? Train? Back soon??\" I think I'll have to put a 3 cent stamp on her and send her to you. Daddy's letter came yesterday saying Helen was going to have twins again! My gosh!! Thought we were doing a pretty good job of keeping up with the Dreges but we've given it up now. Sure hope Helen can carry them through alright. I must write to her this afternoon. I got the foot lockers cleared out of the living room and the floors cleaned up and clean sheets on the beds yesterday, so will have to wash clothes today. Also got my 2 good gowns washed out and they didn't stain at all. How was your trip?? Did you have enough money? Or go on a diet till you got home? This is short, but gotta quit and make formula, bathe and feed my boys, and then start on the wash. The lads are almost out of diapers. Thank you so much for everything you did for us, Mom, and I do hope I didn't wear you out too badly. I don't know what I'd have done without you or how we'll ever repay you, but want you to know that we really did appreciate it. Gee, but mothers are wonderful things!! Write when you find time and tell us all about your trip. \n",

      "Your letter came Monday, Daddy. I had a feeling it was news about Helen and was almost afraid to open it. How is she doing now? I feel so sorry for her and Les and it really makes us appreciate our boys. Well, we'll be seeing you next week about Thursday or Friday. We're leaving here this Friday the 13th and going up to Lebec, then to San Luis Obispo to see Marie and on to Porterville and Stockton and then on home. Mutt is being sent to Florida after all. He had a choice of that or being put in a \"pool\" here. Well, all overseas shipments take a few men out of the pool so rather than take chances of going overseas, we decided to go to Florida. Our furniture is being shipped by van, and they'll be here to pick up everything Friday afternoon and we'll leave as soon as they get stuff loaded. We're shipping everything but Karen's potty chair this time. We got car beds for the boys and a bottle warmer that plugs into the cigarette lighter, so we're all set as far as they go. By the way, Mom, Rodney and Richard and their big sister went down and got that purse their grandma wanted, so they will bring that along when they come instead of mailing it. Did you ever find those pictures? I'll check through the magazines in the magazine rack, but that's the only place I haven't looked. I washed clothes yesterday and had 9 lines of them. Hadn't washed since Friday so was really running low on everything. The diaper drawer even ran dry last night. Mutt has been coming home about noon every day and has been chief bottle washer and formula man here. Sure miss you, though, Mom, and Karen \"Ma-mo\"-s all day long. I told her that you went home to Grandad and Frank on the train, so she said, \"Okay\" and then turns right around again and says, \"Wha Ma-mo?\" Yesterday both boys were crying and she went in there and climbed up on the side of the crib and said, \"'Top it, baby boy budders!\" She's been a pretty good girl the past few days. Maybe it's the calm before the storm. Mutt should be home this morning because he gets paid this morning at 10. At least he's supposed to. It's the rest of his April 30 check, but things have been so messed up there that they didn't know which squadron was supposed to pay him. Well, gotta fold clothes and iron clothes, bathe and feed the babies, make orange juice for them, and begin packing again. Mom, you said you'd come back and help us move when we moved again, but we'll excuse you this time, seeing we're coming up that way. Here's where we'll be from now on in case you want to contact us for anything: now till Friday, here; Saturday, 401 Mauer Ave, Porterville; Sunday, c/o Clyde Jones, 1751 Sunnyside, Stockton, California; Monday, between there and North Dakota someplace. Hope all goes well with Helen and we'll see you soon. \n",

      "Here we are at last in the wild and wintry northland! We got in here about 5:30 PM yesterday in pitch darkness. It had been dark then for a couple hours. Gets light about 7:30 AM. Now for our trip. Will start with our departure from the hostess house or thereabouts. Tried to call Uncle Leo's all day Monday and Tuesday and couldn't get them but finally got a hold of them on Wednesday, November 9 AM and they came to see us that PM. They're both looking good but still seem kinda jittery after the accident. We had a real nice visit with them. Tuesday, November 8 nite Lorraine and Dan and Kellen and their two came to see us. Danny Kay is the image of his daddy and kinda chubby. Bonnie is small and a very pretty little girl with big blue eyes and long blonde curls. Lorraine and Dan both look fine. Dan works with oil heaters installing and repairing about the same work as Bill Ronig does, I believe. Didn't see Mrs Elmer Johnson, but Lorraine said that she still feels fine out here and has never had any more of those spells. She says her dad has aged a lot. Eugene Keller is in Kodiak, Alaska, in the Navy Air Force but don't know just where that is from here. Sergeant and Mrs. Potts and family were up to see us Tuesday night, too. They're stationed just a few miles from here. (From Seattle that is.) Now for our departure. We had to leave all our luggage tags and outside our door at 6:30 AM Thursday November 10. Then we all met in the lobby of the hostess house at 8:30 and government buses took us to the ship. As we got off the bus there were Filipino stewards from the ship standing there to carry all the babies aboard ship and help you locate your state room. Dependents all travel first class. We had two lower and two upper bunks and a davenport which made into a bed. Our room had five clothes closets, private bathroom with shower, toilet and wash bowl. Naturally this being my first experience on the ship, I was all eyes. The thing that struck me the funniest was the slant of the floor. They aren't built level but on a decided slant with the higher level towards the center of the boat. There was lots of drawer space, one big chest of drawers with seven drawers and three drawers under each of the two lower bunks and the davenport. The sendoff we got was very impressive, I thought. Almost everyone was up on deck and the army band played as we were towed out of port. Don't remember what the first songs were, but the last was Auld Lang Syne, and the one before that was \"Now Is The Hour\". Gave me kind of a funny feeling to look out at all that endless expanse of water, which seemed to lead to nowhere, but we got here, so guess it led somewhere! As soon as the boat got underway we went back to our rooms and our room steward came with life preservers. Then there were a series of whistle toots and everybody donned their life preservers and proceeded up to B deck (we were down on C) to their designated boat station for fire drill. It's just a practice drill so that everyone will know where to go in case of emergency and so that people won't all clutter to one life boat. We had two drills, one the second day out. When we came onboard ship we were given a card so we know when to go to meals and which place at what table was yours. You kept the same place every meal. There was a nursery, too, where you took all babies that didn't eat regular meals. They had plenty of cribs, and high chairs and the mothers brought their babies in there 15 minutes before meal time and could feed them before they themselves went to eat. Your bottles were washed and formula made every day for you and there was baby food warmed up and ready to feed the babies when you went in the nursery. We were just two doors from the nursery and right next-door to the hospital. Also right across the aisle from the passenger laundry. Down the hall a ways was a children's playroom, complete with tables, chairs, lots of black boards, drinking fountain, toys, and a children's bathroom off of that. Dining room was at the end of the hall and talk about food!! Anything and everything you wanted. The last evening at sea is the captains dinner. Everyone spruces up a bit and the dining room is all decorated with streamers, balloons, etc. Beside each plate is a paper hat and a special menu with a picture of the Frederick Funston and the names of his crew. Those we got out to keep for souvenirs. That is also the time everyone tips their dining room steward. There was a library and several lounges up on the deck. Also a theater but yours truly didn't get much chance to frequent any of  those. When I got up on B deck it was to get some good old sea breeze in my face to try to settle my stomach. Don't know what we'd have done without our Pappy on this trip. Rodney threw up once and then Karen let go with a merry heave-ho during the night. (Ahh, that wonderful plastic cover on her pillow sure saved the day that time). Mutt didn't get sea sick at all. Now, the mama?? Don't like to report on her! Didn't feel good when I got on the ship and still don't feel very perk. Spent most of the time in a deck chair on deck or in my bunk. Don't know which is the worst, the air or the sea, but have no love for either. Think I'll hitchhike back. The boat docked four hours ahead of schedule and the passengers weren't allowed to get off and the daddies weren't allowed to get on the boat. Talk about excited kids and mamas!! The train track is right along the dock so we got right on the train and headed this way. It was raining all the time we were docked in Whittier but was snowing when we got on the train. Wasn't snowing enough to cover the ground when we started out but we went through a long tunnel and when we came out the other side of the mountain it was like coming into a winter fairyland. Gee, it was beautiful! Everything was white and the streams and lakes and trees and mountains all looked so pretty. You should have heard the kids when we emerged from that tunnel!! It was probably the first time a lot of them had seen snow and they squealed and oohed and ached and then the questions came!! \"Mama, how come 'this'\"? And \"Mama, how come 'that'\"? It was really interesting to see the varied reactions of the daddies and children to each other. Most of the babies looked kinda puzzled at their daddies, some ignored them completely and hung onto mama, and others were too tired from the trip to realize it was daddy. There was a first lieutenant who sat across the aisle from us on the train and was he a card. He hadn't seen his son since he was 6 weeks old and now he is nine months old, and every time somebody walked by the proud papa said, \"Gee, I haven't seen him since he was six weeks old and he sure is big now\". All in all it was a pretty happy reunion for everyone. It really is a wonderful experience and one I know we'll remember a long time. Gotta sign off. Rachel Rounsovall and her boys just came. They're moving into the other half of this duplex. All for now. Love, Betty.\n",

      "6:10 PM and no papa yet. He may have had to fly to Cole Bay today, he wasn't sure. Got some pictures so will send them all home and maybe everyone will get to see them eventually. Sent one set to the Joneses, too. January 11, 7:30 AM. Gonna get this off or bust!! Gonna go house hunting today, so had to stay up this morning. I've been going back to bed till 9 or 10 AM because the kids won't sleep unless all the lights are out and it's such a small apartment that every light shines on them. The little devils won't go to sleep till we do at night and are up at six when the alarm goes off and only sleep about an hour, once in awhile two, during the day and I know it isn't enough sleep for them. Have an appointment at the hospital Monday morning at nine to have them circumcised. Richard caught cold yesterday so may not be able to be fixed up, but am going to steam him good and maybe it will break before then. Richard has three upper teeth now and poor little Rodney doesn't have any. He has four uppers ready to pop and he's been pretty fussy so maybe they'll come through pretty soon. They both pull up on the sides of the crib and stand there. Richard has been one jump ahead of Rodney all the time, but holy smokes has Rodney speeded up lately! He's quick as lightning and so wiry. Almost have to hog-tie him to get diapers on him. You should see those two fight! They pull hair, slap, and crawl all over each other. It's getting to be a common occurrence to hear one yelling and find the other one sitting on the squealing brother's full stomach. They say \"Dada\" all day long and when you try to get them to say \"Mama\" they squeal \"Dada dada dada\" just as loud and indignant as can be. Such boys! Getting sweeter every day. Had them on the floor the other day and fist thing I knew Karen was yelling bloody murder! Richard took her pillow away from her and was on his stomach hanging onto the pillow for dear life and the biggest devilish grin on his face. She's really going to catch the dickens from him when they get a little older. Every time she gets close to the crib he grabs a handful of her hair and stands there holding tight, with that Jimmy Drege grin, while Karen yells for help. Ahhhh, never a dull moment!! Rodney is just as active now, I believe, but doesn't look for the devilment that Richard does. Not yet, anyway. What's happened to you people back there?? Is Mom sick or something?? Haven't had a letter from her since before Christmas which is pretty unusual for her! I owe Pat a letter and Fritzie, too. Haven't written a thank-you letter to Lil and Frank yet. Gee, only six more days before they become a family of 3, or four?? Karen has enjoyed her crayons so much. Fritzie says that Bruce has named their daughter-to-be \"Jennifer Jean\". I think that's real cute. Don't know if I'll have a husband or not tonight. He may have to fly to Barter Island today. Our household goods got here yesterday and have to be delivered by the 16th, so that's why we're looking for a bigger place. Only two in sight so far. Each have two bedrooms. One is $75 a month plus utilities, unfurnished, and no bathroom or water but a pump outside the door. The other is $150 a month plus utilities furnished but has bath and water. Gonna look at the furnished one today and check on furniture prices for the other one. Then on Saturday, Mutt and I are going to see the unfurnished one. Mutt is supposed to get paid today. They've got his pay all mixed up. Should have drawn $404 on payday and all he got was $91 and was he mad!! Don't blame him, because a $300 difference is pretty rough. He went over to the finance office yesterday and guess it's all straightened out pretty well now, so we'll come out alright next month. Was Santa Claus good to you people? He sure was good to us. Too good, I think. Can't find room for everything here. Wait till we get our bigger place, though. We'll get lost in two bedrooms, living room, and kitchen. There's been an intestinal flu going around. Rounswall has been home for four or five days with it. Karen had a touch of it, and guess that's what I had, too. Anyway, everybody is on the mend now, thank goodness! Gotta get the Dec 29 Collier's today and read all about the 10th Rescue Squadron. There are three series of it. The Commanding Officer, Colonel Bernt Balchen, has really made the squadron famous up here. You can find an article about it almost every paper you pick up here. Well, hope nothing is wrong at home. Hope it's just that you're busy. Have been kind of worried because haven't heard from either Helen or Mom, so had a feeling something was wrong at home. \n",

      "Have a big ironing dampened and haven't cleaned the kitchen yet, but will take time off while the kids are taking their naps. They were up at 7:30 AM so were ready to go to bed again now. We overslept this morning till 7:15, so Pop didn't get any breakfast but a glass of milk. He hasn't been feeling very well. Has had headaches for days at a time and night before last lost his meals, so reported at sick call yesterday morning. His blood pressure is up again and he was to go back for a recheck this morning. IF his headaches don't disappear they're going to hospitalize him for a week or so. It's possible they're a hangover from his spinal meningitis, too. He said this morning that his headache was better, so will know more when he comes home tonight. He is supposed to leave either this week or next for two weeks or more at Barter Island (not far from Point Barrow) but he may have to go with the second bunch later on, if his headaches don't go. Aspirin don't touch them, and he even took one of those PAC with codeine capsules that Doctor OW gave me for sleeping sickness headaches and that didn't phase it. Will keep you posted on our papa. Karen has been fine now, and Richard is too full of the devil to get sick. Gee, he's a live-wire. Rodney had a temp of 102.4 last night, but it's normal this morning. Don't know what caused it except that he has a little runny nose. He's my cuddle bug! Just loves to be rocked, and no fat grandma to rock him!! Can just see Richard and Rodney and their Grandma and Grandpa Fay. Grandma would rock Rodney, and Richard would beat the stuffin' out of Grandpa and get rid of the pipe and glasses in a hurry. We had quite a day yesterday. I didn't have any dress to put on till I had ironed one, so it was noon before I got dressed. Bathed, dressed, and fed my trio first and dampened the ironing. About 12:30 Rachel and her boys came over as Bud worked all night and she couldn't keep the kids quiet, so came over to gab with me while the kids played outside. Then Grace Anderson (the captain's wife from next door) came over about 2 or so and we all gabbed, then Mutt came home early (about 2) with groceries. Discovered Karen was over at Andersons playing in the house so went over there to get her about 3:30 and was just in time for coffee. Got home after 4:00 and had to wash dishes and get supper. Such a lazy day. Have to wash again tomorrow. The timer got broken on the machine, but it washes good anyway. Mutt put up some lines in the hallway and my machine wrings the clothes out dry enough so that they dry in three or four hours, so we do it all here now. We were averaging $4 or $5 a week for laundry, so figure we're saving quite a bit by doing it ourselves. Sure good to have our machine and still swear it's the best machine I've ever seen. It gets the clothes so much whiter than when we took them to the launderette. By the way, they have new Maytags there, and they aren't any good. Last Wednesday Rachel and I went to town to get a crochet hook for me while the Papas Jones and Rounsavalls baby sat there and we got to see the dog sled races. It was rather interesting and saw some beautiful Husky dogs. One fellow had a team of seven snow white Siberian dogs that were pretty, too The weather was so nice that they had to haul snow in on the streets for the dog sled races and ski races. Would you have had to do that in North Dakota??? Ended up without a crochet hook as all the stores except drug stores were closed. (\"Washington's Birthday\" and Anchorage's big celebration, the \"Fur Rendezvous\"). Ran into Doris Donaldson and she asked about the maternity dresses. I told her that Pat might want them, but I'd let her know in a few days, so send the verdict soon as you can, please. Thank you! How is \"Becca\"? Karen heard an announcement about a \"Rebecca\" lodge the other day and got so excited because \"Becca\" was on the radio. I made the sad mistake of telling her the other day that Pat and Donnie would probably have two babies and maybe Pat would give her one of them. Now she tells everyone that Pat is gonna have lots of babies and, quote, \"her gonna give Karen one\" unquote. (Pat, you wouldn't disappoint her, would you???) Another good one our daughter pulled on her Daddy! I was getting dressed the other day and Karen was all eyes and finally patted her chest and said, \"Mommie, me hasn't any of those\". I told her she'd have some when she gets big like Mamma. Then a couple days later Mutt was sitting here without a shirt on and she looked and looked at him and finally crawled up on his lap and said so consolingly, \"Daddy, you'll have some when you get big like Mamma\". He got quite a kick out of it. Bet he is looking forward to that day!! Sunday evening he put her in her high chair and was putting her bib on her and called her a baby. She said, \"I no baby, Daddy\". He replied, \"the hell you're not\", and she looked up at him and said, \"The hell I not\". Surprised the sox off her pa! Guess we'll have to watch what we say around here. Jeepers! It's 1:30 already! Better get a roast in the oven. Won't you join us? Also have the coffee pot on and no one to sup with me. By the way, are you coming up to see us \"between babies\" this summer? Could you get Ann Shively Tillman's address from her folks for me? It's about a half mile to the nearest phone, so practically next to impossible to track her down through the Standard Oil Company. Am sure she wouldn't be listed in the phone directory yet. Gotta get to work. Toodle-oo for now and write again. Sure am good to get your letters. PS Radio man says 26 degrees above. Pop felt good yesterday morning so didn't go to sick call. Got sick in the afternoon and came home sick again. No supper. Feels good this morning and ate a good breakfast. Toodle-oo, gonna go to bed!! The babies fussed all night but are sleeping now. \n",

      "Well, this is the third letter I've started to you and maybe I'll finish this one. Mutt plans on calling you from Colorado Springs either tomorrow or the next day, so this will all be old news to you by then. We had planned on surprising you about August 7, but by the sounds of things guess we won't wait that long. Seems like I'm following Helen's pattern. Started losing water over a week ago and guess I lost most of it, so they plunked me in here a week ago today and both Captain Guest and Colonel Saxer (he's a friend of Uncle Gus') say I won't carry it through and that I will definitely have a miscarriage before I get out of here. I feel wonderful, though. No aches, no pains, not flowing a speck but am kept flat in bed all the time. I still have hopes of carrying it through if something doesn't happen pretty soon. They say I'll stay right where I am till something does happen. Come and see me in July. I'll probably still be here. Rachel and Bud and the boys moved in to take care of the boys and Karen for what I thought would be two or three days and are still there. Don't know if they'll stay till I get out or not. It's quite a load to drop on them all at once and Rachel hasn't been feeling too well, either. She has thyroid trouble and also some other female trouble, so don't know if she can take it all or not. It didn't help matters any that Mutt had to go to the states right now, either, but there was no alternative. They had to have a radar operator and he's the only one on the base right now, so there were no ands, ifs, or buts about it. They took General Frank Armstrong, General Twining, and Colonel Balchen to Camp Carson for a conference and plan to be back here about the 21st or 22nd so it won't be too long. We debated and debated about whether to tell you about our situation here right now for fear you'd worry, but Mutt couldn't call you from Colorado and tell you everything was fine when it wasn't so finally decided the truth was the best way. Now you know. How are the rest of your pregnant family? Looks like 1950 is production year for the Fays, doesn't it? Mutt brought the Tribune up here Saturday and I had the laugh of my life!! For heaven's sake, tell Frank Hornstein the \"bears\" don't get that close to us that they might open the door and run off with one of our children. The only Bear Bruin I've seen was a mighty dead one sticking out the trunk of some lucky hunter's car. I wouldn't have wanted to exactly shake hands with the old fellow dead or alive anyway because he looked pretty gruesome even if he was dead! Sure did get a kick out of the article, anyway. Never miss reading his column because that's what makes the paper, but was sure surprised to pick up the paper and read about the Joneses in it. Well, Mom, tomorrow you greet your fifties, don't you? Gee, I landed in here so fast I didn't even get a card off to you, but will wish you a happy birthday, anyway, and will be thinking of you puffing hard enough to blow out that added candle. Mutt was a pretty worried man when he left here last night wondering what to do and what plans to make for the kids for the next couple months and wondering what would happen here while he was gone and a dozen other things. Rachel was just here and looks very much alive. Glad to see she's surviving it all. She says she's getting along fine with the kids and she didn't look like she had turned gray haired yet, so guess she will make it. March 14, 1950. Happy birthday, Mom!! Went to sleep last night and didn't finish this so will add some more. It's 8 AM. Have had breakfast, my bath, my penicillin shot, etc so am all set for another day. Guess I'd better finish \"Becca's booties\" today and get them off to her before she gets too big for them. I have finished one bootie and both the thumbless mittens for her and am almost through with the other bootie. Tell Frank that the booties have been examined by a General's wife and they were pronounced \"darling, quaint, and beautiful\" so no doubt after wearing them Becca will be the world's First Lady general, \"General Rebecca Fay\", in about 1980 or 1990, that is! Mrs. Twining has been in here about a month, but gets a hospital pass to go home weekends. She has a \"trick\" knee (one that snaps out of joint without warning) and is in the wheelchair a good share of the time. She's a very good patient and expects no special favors or attention which some of the \"brass\" demand. Guess I'll quit for now. Send any mail to the squadron address as I don't know how long I'll be here or if they will deliver mail here at the hospital. Don't worry about stuff and things here. I'm not. Figure old Mother Nature knows what she's doing one way or another and whatever happens or doesn't happen will no doubt be for the best.\n",

      "Richard just had another penicillin shot and is trying hard to go to sleep, so I'll tell you our latest troubles! Yes, we're in the hospital again. This time it's Richard with tracheobronchitis. He got sick Saturday. Took his temperature Saturday evening and it was 104.6 degrees. Took him to the dispensary and saw the pediatrician. All he could find wrong was a little tonsillitis so gave him a shot of penicillin and we took him home again. Sunday morning his temperature was 103.6 degrees at 10:30 AM and by 4:30 PM was 105 degrees. I gave him cool enemas, aspirin, and alcohol sponge baths and his temperature just wouldn't give an inch. Took him back to the dispensary and he got another shot of penicillin. Took him home and Mutt and I took turns bathing him with the alcohol and his temperature hit 105.6 degrees. Finally got it down to 104.6 degrees and Mutt covered him up good and rocked him and he finally started to perspire. Worked with him till 11 PM and it finally went down to 102.4 degrees, so put him in Karen's bed and I slept with him and Karen crawled in with her Daddy. Monday morning his temperature was 99.8 degrees at 9:30 AM. At 12:30 PM it was 103.6 degrees, at 1:15 PM it was 104 degrees so took him to the dispensary. Took a chest x-ray and his chest is clear. Captain Guinn gave me a syringe and needles and some penicillin so I could give him shots every three hours at home. By 5 PM his temperature was 105.4 degrees again after having two cooling enemas, sponge baths for an hour and aspirin, so we called Captain Guinn and he said to bring him out here right away. His temperature was 99.8 degrees this morning and at noon, but he is so listless. He just seems completely worn out and when he sits up his eyes get so hazy and he looks like it's all he can do to sit there. It will probably be awhile before he gets back on the right track after running such a high fever so continually for that long a time. Now here's the latest. Captain Guinn says we should get these babies out of Alaska, because he doesn't think they're going to be well till we do and he feels we definitely shouldn't spend another winter up here with them. He is writing a letter recommending an emergency medical return to the states for us and Mutt is to pick up the letter today. We will very, very likely be back in the states next month. It all depends on whether they will risk flying me back now that I've hit the 7 month mark, or will tomorrow. Rather risky to take off at 8 months and that's what I'll be by the time orders are cut on the situation, but we've got to get these babies out of here. They can't take many more sieges like they've been having and still make the grade. Mutt will be transferred someplace in the states but don't have any idea yet just where it might be. We haven't decided definitely whether to go to California or North Dakota. Would you have room for us for awhile????? I hate to move in on anyone with three kids and expecting another one, but we'll have to got wherever Mutt is stationed just as soon as I can travel again. He's been going in circles trying to figure out what to do, particularly on such short notice. He was supposed to fly out to the chain again tomorrow for several days on top of all this, but was going to try to get out of it today. They've got us ion the isolation ward and no visitors are allowed and we're not allowed out of our rooms till we're dismissed so I don't know what the score in the \"outside world\" is. Don't even know if Rodney and Karen are with Rachel, or with Grace Anderson, or just where they are. I'm sure they'll be taken care of anyway. They were both feeling good. Rodney was awfully mad at his mama at times the past few days because Richard was getting so much attention and all Rodney got was bathed, fed, and dry pants. Poor little lamb! Suppose Fritzie and Bruce are there now. Won't be much longer for them, will it? What are they going to name their boy? And what are Pat and Don gonna name their kids??? Heh, heh, all half dozen of them!! Running out of paper. Gonna have to use the other side, too. Got the picture of Fritzie and decided she must be pregnant or something. She doesn't look very big for being about ready to pop. I wrote a letter to Martha Cats, so she will know where I'm at now. Mom, it wasn't Martha you send the package to. That was Ann Fulton. I explained to Martha that you mistook her for Ann and to disregard the part in your letter about the package because you didn't send her any. Martha is from Georgia and was in South Carolina with us the same time Fultons were. I haven't heard from Ann since I got up here, but I'm gonna drop her a line and see if I can track her down. They were in Great Bend, New York the last I heard and were waiting for European orders, so maybe they're in Europe someplace now. Pew!! Think Richard just filled his pants. He sure do stink anyway. Can't tell. Might see you soon. Will let you know as soon as we hear anything definite one way or the other. Love from me and my boy here, and Pa and his kids at home. \n",

      "The time of the gong says 5:25 AM. Aren't I the early bird, though? Mutt flew out to the chain Wednesday morning and they landed here about 2:30 AM this morning and he buzzed in about 4, so I put the coffee pot on, we had coffee, and now he has gone back to get his flying equipment, etc together so he can turn it in this morning. We've got so much to do that we're going in circles. Lieutenant Hendrickson stopped in last night and said that the papers came back yesterday approved and that we will be flying out of here in a week or less!! They're sending us to Great Falls, Montana temporarily, but that will be only till orders come out of Washington as to where Mutt is to go to be stationed. Haven't had official word from you that the kids and I can set up camp in your back yard for awhile or not, but we're going to risk the chance of being thrown out on our ears and we'll be coming home on the first train out of Great Falls after we get that far. We'll call you when we get to Great Falls. Mutt gets 15 days furlough to take us to North Dakota, and then goes back to Great Falls, picks up his orders, and heads for someplace. They have requested Denver, Colorado for us, but hard telling what we'll get. Karen has been talking \"Mama and Bampa\" every day and all day for the past week. She has a new word now, \"pertend\" this and \"pertend\" that. Yesterday it was, \"Pertend you is 'Letter\" and I be Sandy,\" so I \"pertended\". Don't know just where to start with the packing, but have lots of washing and ironing to keep me out of mischief for awhile. Mutt will be off to help with almost all the packing. We've never unpacked our dishes, so just have a few pots and pans to pack along that line of goods. Richard's bottom blossomed out with abscesses from the penicillin shots, so I've been hot-packing that. It sure looks sore, but he doesn't fuss much. Grace has a big boil on her right index finger and I've been doctoring that, too. Went over and put a bread poultice on that last night about 10 bells. Seems like the darned thing just won't \"give\". My land o' living', the sun is shining!! It's rained the past two days, so think I\"d better pull out the machine and start washing. Suppose I'll have to stop before I get a good start and feed and clothe my younguns, but will start, anyway. We should be seeing you in about ten days. Don't lock the door when you see a stampede get off the train, because it'll only be the Joneses! We're leaving our household goods here and they'll be shipped to Mutt's final destination as soon as he gets orders in Great Falls. Won't bring any more than we absolutely have to this time so we won't clutter the place up like we did last time. Gotta make hay while the sun shines. Will see you soon. Love from us all, Betty. PS Any objections if I take a couple days off while I'm home and increase our family?? If so, just say so and I'll wait till next year to have \"it\"! Saturday AM. Sure get lots of advance notice. Leaving here about 2 AM Tuesday June 20th, Sally's birthday. Go to Fairbanks and from there to Great Falls. Should be home Thursday. Not going commercial airlines. Traveling MATS, Military Air Transport Service. Don't know where to begin packing. Amen!! Just think, 4 days and we'll be in the USA. Mom's letter came yesterday, thanks! Saturday PM. Latest change, leaving here Monday PM. Will be home Wednesday very likely. Will call from Great Falls. \n",

      "This letter came yesterday and Pop said we'd better open it as they might want something for the wedding. I just wrote a note to Mrs. Chilson and told her you had gone to Grand Forks so wouldn't be here for the wedding. Told her if there was anything else we could do for her for her to call us. How is Mr. Randy? Karen told us this morning that \"Mamo went on the train to wash Bruce's baby\". She's been over to see Mama Delly this morning and came back to tell me that \"Mama Delly says me can bisit her awhile cuz I not bisit her for long time\". Pat and Don were over last night for awhile and had coffee and cake with the old widow and the old widower. Marie Beck and Evelyn Romig both called me yesterday and chatted for about half an hour each, so am about gabbed out. No news here, anyway. Give Randy a big love for me. How is the father faring?? The mothers usually come through pretty well, but it's often rough on the fathers! Think Rodney's been eating Limburger cheese again. Pew!\n",

      "This will probably be a book before I'm through, but you don't mind, I'm sure. Haven't much good news for you this time. Went to see Doctor Fox yesterday and the baby is turned wrong again and the head is up by my ribs. It was pretty discouraging news, but nothing can be done about it now, as it's too late in the game to try to turn it. It won't make any difference except that I'll probably go till the 15th of August. Pleasant thought, isn't it? I had hoped we could be back together by then, but it looks like it will be longer than we had figured on. I asked him how soon I could travel and he said if the baby should turn around, which he doesn't think will happen, then I could go in about two weeks after the delivery. If the baby comes breech, then I'll have more stitches and wouldn't be able to travel for at least three weeks or more, so that'll probably make it September before I get out of here. As for a diaphragm they're almost 100% foolproof. Says as long as we used it right we wouldn't have to worry about increasing our family any more. Everything else is fine. Blood getting up to par gradually and urine is okay. Blood pressure and everything else is okay, too. So much for that. Stopped at the bank and got our bank statement. Also cashed and deposited Chacon's check. Our bank balance at present is $181.88. That's what it will read when all the checks get in, anyway. Paid $30 on the grocery bill this month. Pop's bill was $106 at Bickler's this month, but Mom has been canning so that included 100 pounds of sugar ($10), 1 crate of peaches and cherries, and then Catherine and Buzz and 2 kids were here for a couple days, too, so that made the bill bigger. Helen was at the clinic yesterday, too, and guess what ails her!! Yep, she's pregnant again. Her blood is up good this time and Doctor C.G. Johnson said there was no reason why she shouldn't carry this one through. She's due March 25 and are they excited. Sure hope she goes through okay this time. She feels fine and weighs 102 pounds now, which is more than she has weighed for several years, so she's got a good chance of making a go of it this time. Now I know what to do with my maternity clothes when I leave, too. Honey, disregard that letter I wrote the other day about changing our \"girls\" name. I was kinda down in the dumps that day and so cross I had to watch myself all day to keep from biting somebody's head off and every time I said something about \"Frances\" I'd have to explain \"Frances Maudeen\" and it just got my goat. Just one of those nerve wracking pregnant days when everything upsets me. I've had quite a few of them the last few days, but think it's just the impatience of waiting to get it over with, everyday hoping this is the day and then nothing happens. I miss you so darn much, too, and when day after day goes by I'm still sitting here waiting for action I know it will be just that much longer before I can see you again. Gruesome thoughts, aren't they? I've been crocheting a bonnet to go with the sweater and booties so should finish that any day now. I've forgotten to get belly binders for the twerp, but am just going to cut a few out of flannel instead of buying them. How was the ball game?? Am so glad you went, because you need something to look at besides barracks walls once in a while. I don't worry about you spending your time at the bar, Honey, because I have lots of faith in your will power to stay away from there now, and it's such a relief not to have that worry. It's been a year now, and what a wonderful year!! Just took time out to check on our little family. The babies are in the playpen happy as larks and Karen is digging dirt and singing away. She sure misses you. I hear, \"Is our baby at the hospital yet, so my Daddy can come home?\". That is asked at least once a day and sometimes six or seven times. Think she's given up hope that it's ever going to get here. Yippee!! Sadie just brought me a letter from T/Sgt. Francis Jones. Know him! Egads. What scandal!! What in the world ever hit the 606th that it got that rough? Can just see that Joe telling the officers off. Bet that was a one man side show in itself, cuz he was strictly a character. Couldn't help but like him even if I did blame him for some of the sprees you two had, but Joe's a good egg, anyway. Wonder if they didn't adopt a war orphan, seeing the birth announcement come from Germany. Well, it's 6:30 PM now. Guess I'd better get on the beam. We washed clothes this morning and they're ready to be brought in, Mom's cleaning the basement, Margie just came back from the clinic after having her ears cleaned out and she can hear again, Sadie just got home from work, Pop just came from downstairs, and the kids are in the house, so no use trying to write any more. Will keep you posted what \"pops\" here. PS Aren't the pictures good? Gotta take our two little sheep down to Barb Liming and get them sheared one of these days. They sure look wooly.\n",

      "I'm still here and feeling fine, darn it!! Have some sick kids, though. Took Richard with me when I went to see Fox at the clinic yesterday and he sent me over to the hospital with Richard and I brought him home again this afternoon. He was so dehydrated from that diarrhea he's had that they had to give him a sub-cutaneous feeding. That's when they stick a needle into the thigh and let fluid run right into the tissues. They gave him a pint and started it at 4:30 PM yesterday and it ran until 3 AM. He got some penicillin shots and streptomycin shots, too, so is all shot up again. His breath had gotten so that it smelled just rotten and he was so weak he staggered when he walked. Hope this clears it up. He has only had one dirty diaper today and he had 8 to 10 a day before so you see it is a lot better. Rodney is fine. I stayed at the hospital till 9:30 last night and then Mom was up and stayed till about 9 this morning, and I came home and slept. Karen was up most of the time till 4 AM with diarrhea and wouldn't get off the potty. Quote: \"Cuz I gotta biz some more all the time, Mommie\". I gave her a dose of medicine and put her back to bed with me and she slept till 8 this morning. Then she drank a glass of milk and vomited it all up. She was back at the table 5 minutes later and ate a bowl of cream of wheat and kept it all down, so she must be better, too. She just had another bowl of it now and a glass of boiled milk, so guess she's on the mend, too. Both she and Richard are on a cream of wheat, boiled milk, and rice water diet and take it pretty well. Rodney has been on it, but he's okay now, so can't see any sense keeping him on it as long as he is okay. Got a letter from you this afternoon and one from Sibyl so I had lots to read. Sure good to get your letters. I haven't written since Saturday night and here it is Wednesday and I'm just getting around to write again. Fox said yesterday it would be a couple more or maybe 3 days at least before our wee one arrives, but that it could come anytime. It's still breech and guess it will be now, but I'm not in the least worried about the delivery. Cats!! Did you ever try writing a letter with three kids crawling all over you? Believe me, it's a job. Rodney has been so blamed naughty today. Neither Karen nor Richard feel too good and Rodney is in one of those \"I'll do my best to beat up on you\" moods and has had both Karen and Richard yelling almost steady since 2:00 and the clock just struck 4 now, so he's really been at it. I'm sending you some little pictures like the big ones I sent you. I ordered reprints so that I could end your mother some and they came back little prints. Don't think she'll be able to see the little ones very well, so thought if I sent you the little prints then you could send the big ones to them. Okay?? Mom, Cora Crook, and Mrs. Hjelle drove out to Mrs. Frdje's farm this afternoon to pick raspberries, Margie's at the clinic getting her ear checked and Pop is downtown, so the kids and I are alone this afternoon. Thought it would be a good time to try to write a letter to you, but the kids have almost run me ragged. They're not real bad, just mischievous. Honey, would we spend the winter in Michigan with you??? Cats, Honey, when we get able to travel we'll travel anyplace with you and you won't be able to chase us off with a shotgun! Believe I'd go with you even if they sent us back to Alaska, but sure hope they don't get any wild idea like that. Don't worry about the money, Honey. They'll let me have the baby whether I can pay for it right away or not. Our hospital bill for Richard was $13.33 and I paid that today. Have to get a prescription filled for some iron and vitamin stuff like they had last fall and suppose that will be $4 or $5 again, but it will all come out in the wash. Must close and go cook some more cream of wheat. Don't suppose the kids will ever look at it again after this siege of it three times a day. Can't say as I'd blame them exactly either. All for this time, Honey, and still have hopes of sending you a telegram one of these days soon. Gee, it can't be much longer! Fox says only a girl could be this late for a date and as stubborn as this baby is, so maybe we'll get a girl! I'll let you know for sure one of these days.\n",

      "Tis 5 p.m. and Mutt doesn't get off work till 8 a.m. So I'm not going to get a big supper tonight. We've got sick kids again! Had Rodney out to the dyspensary last night. He was running a fever of 104 again. His chest is clear, but his nose is runny and his throat is inflamed. He had Penicillin last night and may have to go for another one tonight. His temp was 104 again at 3:30 and I gave him aspirin and some medicine the Doctor gave us. It's an anhistamine (the medicine not the ailment) called \"Elixir of Parahenzamine\". Now you know all about it. Richard and Mark have colds, too, but they're not bad. Karen just has spunk and lots of it!! Haven't got the house cleaned yet. It hadn't been cleaned since the last renters moved out, so there's lots to be done. I've got the kitchen pretty well cleaned out and the kids bedroom and the bathroom, but that's all. The kids and I all had baths this p.m. and I think it gave the kids new life, cuz they've been full of the old nick ever since. We had company for supper last night. Fellow by the name of Jim Bryant! Ask Pat, she'll tell you who he is, cuz she met him before. He got transferred here yesterday and ran into Mutt first thing, so Mutt brought him home with him. He's been in New York till now. He's married (last December) and his wife is going to college. She as 22 months left before she gets her degree in Home Economics. She was raised right next door to him in Kentucky. (No, Pat, it's not the schoolteacher he'd been going with.) Now for our trip. Stopped the first night just east of St. Paul. Second night in Woodstock, Illinois, and the last night just outside of Detroit. It wasn't too bad a trip but quite a bit slower than the others have been. The lunch came in mighty, mighty handy! We stopped at Parks along the way and ate one meal a day so the kids could wear off a little energy. It seemed to tame them down for a little while. Karen was kind of disgusted with her Daddy, one place we stopped, because he wouldn't climb a tree and chase a squirrel for her! I had quite a time getting enough for Mark to eat, but am drowning him again now. I've gotten him a little spoiled, I'm thinking, cuz he loves to be rocked, but that only happens about once a day, so that's not too bad. Still waiting to hear for Pat!! She didn't change her mind and decide not to have it this year did she?? All 3 big kids bellering, so that's all for this time, amen! September 14 Thursday a.m. 7:30. Here I go again! Mutt just left for work, twins sleeping, Mark on my lap, and Karen on the floor singing \"Farmers In the Dell\" while she puts her shoes and socks on. Had a bad boy last night. Mark H. was squawking cuz his mama ate cantalope yesterday so he refused to sleep since 3:45 this morning. I've got him on his tummy across my lap and he has been blowing breezes and burping to beat the cars and dozes in between times. Rodney is due at the clinic again tomorrow. Had him out there Saturday and Sunday nites and Monday and Tuesday morning and yesterday at 1 p.m. His temperature was 105 Sunday nite and has been normal since Tuesday morning but he's got a penicillin reaction now and his eyelids are puffy and he's blossomed out with a rash from head to foot. He scratches like a monkey with fleas. They x-rayed his chest and it's congested pretty well again. It's rained everyday this week so haven't been able to put the kids outside. Still no word of Mutt's transfer. Guess they're pigeon holed it in Washington someplace. Mutt got his new blue uniform yesterday and it fits to a T. Nothing like the fit of some they used to issue. He will be a sharp looking cookie when he gets all called up in that. For heaven's sake what's happened to Donita Jane or Ronald LeRay???? Have been 'bout to die, waiting to hear about \"it.\" What's Pat doing? Waiting for \"it\" to grow so it will be able to wear the booties she made? We figured out this new allotment business and Mutt will make $17.50 a month on it. It'll probably cost Uncle Sam twice that to change the paperwork on his records. Richard just came out here and does he stink!! Wish they'd decide where they're gonna keep us so I can invest in a couple potty chairs and then heaven help the kids if they don't use them! Grrrrr. That's the old lady talking! Sure do appreciate all you folks did for the kids and I while we were home. We'll make it right with you as soon as we can see our way through to do it. Been wondering what Mom and Margie do with all their spare time now. Gotta quit! Got kids all over the place so better dress 'em and feed 'em. Help!! Margie!! P.S. How's Helen?? Send me Aunt Numidia's address, will you?\n",

      "Have the kids bathed and fed and dishes soaking in the sink, so will write a few lines while they soak. That darned Cream of wheat sure sticks. Got your letter yesterday, Mom, and one from Pat, so am a couple jumps behind on letters again. Rodney is fine. Full of the old dibil and ornerier than heck! The other 3 are okay, too. They are outside most of the time but it's raining today, so are all in here and not too crazy about the idea. Mutt got Karen a \"Little Nurse\" set, so she's busy taking care of the boys. You can actually hear the heart beat through the stethoscope, and it has an otoscope (for ears and eyes), thermometer, scissors, wristwatch, glasses, etc. Oh, yes, a hypo syringe, too, so everyone has been getting shot every time she gets near one of us. Read in the Tribune all about the prowler you had in Rugby. We really keep the doors locked up around here since that little boy was murdered. They have several suspects but no clues as to who it was. It isn't very far east of here that it happened. October 2, 1950. Heavens!! If I don't get a letter off to you pretty soon, I'll be in the dog house for good! Can't seem to get any correspondence done. We had a little commotion here yesterday about noon. I went out to empty the garbage and while I was gone (about 2 minutes) Rodney drank some fuel oil. He was coughing and choking good when I got in here, and his nose was bleeding and he was blue around the mouth. Mutt had just left to get the car greased, and didn't know where he went, so I got the neighbors across the street to call the Doctor while I tried to get him to vomit. Gave him raw egg white and instead of gagging him he drank it like water. Then tried warm milk, no good. Stuck my finger down his throat, no results except a bitten finger! Neighbors (Charlie Dugan's) couldn't find a Doctor at home, so they called the Police and they came and took us to the hospital. The Doctor there pumped his stomach and then irrigated it with potassium permanganate solution and that was that. He said he'd be okay but to watch him and if he got feverish to bring him right in because he might have gotten some in his lungs, but after a nap he was fine and is as full of the dickens as ever, so guess it didn't faze him. Mr. Dugan came to the hospital to get us because Mutt wasn't home yet, as he hadn't been gone 10 minutes when it happened. Last night we went to a drive-in theatre. They've got a playground for the children, with 14 swings in it, 2 slides, a giant-stride gadget, a merry-go-round, and a merry-go-round with little cars on it, so it's quite a place for the kids while you're waiting for the show to start. The kids were real good and I really enjoyed it. Suppose you heard by now that a 15 year old confessed to the murder of that 8 year old boy last night. They were neighbors, too, and he had been in the search party that was looking for Joe's body, and when they found that headlight that Joe had with him when he disappeared, he said, \"Better be careful when you pick that up. It might have fingerprints on it.\" It had been wiped free of prints. Then he ran away Saturday night and left a note for his mother saying he had \"nothing to do with Joey's death.\" Don't know where they found the boy (the 15 year old) yesterday but he confessed last night. They (the neighbors here) say he was very brilliant in school, almost too bright. Wonder what they'll do with him now. It's 5:10 P.M., so gotta start supper. Mutt gets home about 5:30. I'm gonna fix eggplant tonight. Have only eaten it once before so don't remember what it taste like, but we're gonna find out tonight. I'll try to write again one of these days. I have it pretty easy when all the laundry is done for me. It comes back rough dried, so there's nothing left but the folding and ironing. All for now. \n",

      "Suppose Mom is in Biloxi, so won't include her in this letter. We got here day before yesterday and got this house yesterday. It's a lovely place. The outside doesn't look so nice, but the inside is very nice and the cleanest place we've ever moved into. We have a living room as big or bigger than Pat's and Don's whole apartment, two big bedrooms, a bath, hallway, and big kitchen about the size of your living room. It's nicely furnished with new bedroom suites, big Monkeyward refrigerators, big gas stove, built-in sink and cupboards and regular dining room table and chair set in the kitchen. There is linoleum in the bathroom and kitchen but the other floors are bare. It has furnace heat with thermostat control, but it's too warm for any heat yet. We pay $90, landlord pays all utilities except a phone. There's a phone here so we can get incoming calls, but can call out on it, till we've contacted the phone company and paid a deposit on that. There was a long list of rentals in the paper and almost all rent listed at $125 for 2 bedroom places, so guess we were lucky to get this for $90. That still seems pretty steep, buttttt such is life. The climate is ideal. Warm, but a little breeze with it. The kids have finally taken off their undershirts and even went barefoot for awhile. We stopped in Gravette, Arkansas and saw Mutt's mother and dad. They had gotten there Sunday and we got there Monday forenoon. Sure surprised them. We left there Thursday PM and got in here Friday AM, about 2:00. Drove straight through cuz it was too blamed hot to travel much during the day. We stopped in Oakie City a couple hours or so and looked up one of Mutt's crew members (the pilot) that he flew with overseas. He and his brother have a Gulf \"service station\" just across from Linker Field, and was he glad to see Mutt!! Too bad they didn't have more time, because I think they could out-gab Ruthie and I and that's saying quite a bit. Ho ho ho! Mutt just came in and is he a sight! He's been out in the yard without a shirt on and his back is the prettiest red you ever saw! Thought at his age he'd know better. The lawn looks pretty nice, though. How is little Donita? I hear she's a bottle baby now, too. Mark has had colic yesterday and today, so suppose it's due to change of water again. He's lying on his tummy on a hot water bottle so is pretty peaceful again. He's sure been a good baby, thank heavens! How is Helen making the grade? Sure hope everything goes okay with her this time. I've got the oven heating so I can bake a cake, so better get it in the oven. Then it will be time to get supper started. Haven't got much stuff unpacked yet, but that won't take too long. We've got two clothes closets and imagine we can put 6 or 8 footlockers in them when our stuff gets here. It hadn't gotten to Michigan yet when we left there, so we probably won't see any of it till after the first of the year. Gotta get to work! How are Gussie and Delmer and Earl??? Karen was rattling on about who was whose baby the other day and ended up with, \"And Margie's Grandma Fay's baby, and Earl is Sadie's baby.\" Take good care of your baby, Sadie! \n",

      "Mutt's Mother and Dad and uncle Frank Frances just left for California. They got here about 7:30 last night and Dad Jones has itchy feet to get back to California so they left about 8 this morning. Mom Jones would have liked to stay a couple days, I know, but Dad hates to stop once he's started on the way home. It was the first time they've visited us since we were married, and sure enjoyed their visit, even though it was short. Karen couldn't figure out \"Uncle Frank.\" \"Well, Mommie, my Uncle Frank has a Lillian and Becka Susie. Does Daddy's uncle Frank have a Lillian and Becka Susie?\" He was quite thrilled over the twins and wanted his picture taken with them so he could show his family at home. He lost his wife just a few months ago, but has several married children at home (Wichita, Kansas). Sure is a grand fellow. Think he's about Mom's age. The kids were all up at 5:30 this morning, so are about due to head for their beds for a nap. It's about 10:30 now. I haven't washed dishes yet, either. Feel more like sleeping. Your letter came yesterday with the evidence of Mutt's misspelling. He said he knew he had spelled it wrong, but didn't think you'd still have the letter to catch him on it. Pretty cagey, you were. We were just sitting here thinking of how much we've moved and figured it out to 19 transfers, eleven of them at our own expense because they were listed as TDY (temporary duty), and we've lived in 32 different apartments or houses since we were married (4 years and 1 month). Darned near a record, I'd guess. Now it's Friday a.m. Oh, I'll finish this some day. This is Rodney's day off today, I guess, because he's really been a demon. First he cracked Karen in the corner o the eye with a book, then he grabbed Richard's book away from him and had him by the shirt collar darned near choking him and has done nothing but cause trouble all morning, so he's had his second spanking and is in bed for the second time. This time he will stay put till he cools off a bit! Tuesday, November 1st. Good Morning! Will try again. The twins are fed and outside. Mark is fed and asleep. Mutt had his breakfast, got his pants mended (had a hole in the knee and one in the seat. Gonna salvage them next week and get some new ones, I hope), his lunch packed, and has gone to work, so I should find a few free minutes here. I owe everyone letters I think. Can't seem to catch up. Would you like to hear the latest?? Nothing new, I know, but guess we're being transferred again!!!!!!! This blamed A. C. and W. All they do is bounce, I think. Mutt about blew his stack when they told him he'd be transferred again and told them he'd put in for a dependency discharge. Well, the Colonel asked what Mutt's \"MOS\" (classification of job) was and Mutt told him it was a \"953\" which is radar maintenance and is classified as \"critical.\", in other words, \"jump when we whistle and h--- and high water won't keep you back if we ever want you down below shoveling hot coals.\" That's the general idea of the \"critical\" business, anyway. The the Colonel told him to stick with it and he should get a commission out of it. Mutt says, \"Sir, I turned down a commission last month.\" The Colonel says, \"What?? You turned down a commission?\" Mutt says, \"Yes, sir, it would have meant three months in the states and then to Japan and I'm the father of four small children and needed at home.\" The Colonel says, \"Well, you've got a point there.\" Sooooo they called the classification board and had him re-classified as an 866 (radar operator, airborne) which was his secondary MOS and classified as \"acute\", next to critical, but not quite as demanding. The Colonel says, \"I supposed you know, that means you'll never get back in an A. C. and W. squadron again?\" Mutt says, \"Sir, I think that'll be the best news my wife has ever heard.\" Then he told him how much we've moved and all and the old boy just sat and blinked his peepers rather surprised like. It all boils down to this: Mutt's name is now submitted (today) for transfer to an outfit that needs \"866's\" which might possibly be Hamilton Field, California, or  Marchfield, California. It means another move, but it also means that we're out of A. C. and W. for good and have an excellent chance of staying at our next base for a little more permanent spell, for which I'm shedding no tears!! I've liked it here so\n",

      "Got the shock of our lives yesterday, namely, a letter from you!! Nice shock, though. Thought maybe if I answered right away you might break down and write again sometime. I'm in the doghouse. Karen found the letter she wrote you to say \"Thank you\" for Pete's clothes. I keep forgetting to put it in, but it's in an envelope now, so maybe she won't find it again. She sure has a case on Earl. Says she's going to marry earl when he gets big. I'll try to talk her out of it, because I know you're one jump ahead of her as you're there and she's here!! She talks about your Margie, and Earl all the time. You should see the living room!! Our household goods got here day before yesterday, so we have 20 footlockers, crates, barrels, etc., in there. There was one small box about 2' X 2' X 1 1/2 and I thought it might be the radio, so I got our tools (a pliers and a ballpeen hammer) and pounded and battered and wrestled with it till I got it open. Guess what was in it!! Broken dishes!! not one whole piece in the bunch. We haven't unpacked the barrel of dishes so don't know what's in there. \"Chunk\", maybe, by now. We got the kids toys out and they just went wild! Karen gets up in the morning and comes riding out to the kitchen on her tricycle about 5\"45 or so. The boys take turns riding the tricycle and falling off. We're not going to unpack much of anything till we find out where and when we go next. By the way, Mutt says he thinks it would be very nice if you'd come and spend the summer with us next summer, providing Earl doesn't come and run off with you!! Things like that have happened before. (Hi, Pat, who said you could read this??) It's hard telling where we'll be by then, but you and Margie are welcome to come if you like. Oh, yes, Mutt says \"Ask her if she wants me to locate a blonde, a brunette, or a redhead for her.\" Latah! Much, much Latah!! 1 P.M., November 17, our double-trouble are having difficulty going to sleep, so I'll write while I stand guard over them. I told them if they didn't stop the chatter I was going to lick them and Richard pulled the blanket off his face and with a big grin says, \"Pank? Good byes, good byes.\" (That means good boys) They're finally beginning to talk a little. Can say \"ow, shide\" for outside, shoe, \"shocks,\" pants, pat, and Rodney says \"an oo\" every time you send him something. We opened up all our footlockers and stuff last night and someone had gotten into our stuff and made off with all our groceries! Had a whole footlocker full of canned goods and packaged good and there's a can of prune juice, one of bean sprouts, and a package of coffee cake mix left. We're about fed up with the service!! Mutt has another year left before he can resign and am pretty sure he will then, because we're sure taking a beating. I get mad every time I look at our furniture, broken dishes, and those blessed cans of prune juice and bean sprouts!! If I could get a hold of the fellow that got our groceries, I'd use that prune juice and bean sprout cans and knock little knobs on his head. I haven't griped much before but I'm sure stewing now!! We've taken it all and figured they surely couldn't keep us bouncing forever and keep on tearing up everything we pinch pennies to pay for, but I don't know. Mutt is going to check at \"Transportation\" today and see what can be done about it, but don't imagine we'll ever get anything back for it. If we do, it will be in time to buy wedding presents for our great-grandchildren. Oh, I'm happy, I am, I am, I am. Grrrrrrrrrr. Seems like every time we get one foot ahead of the other and think we're making a little progress, o' Uncle Sammy sticks his foot out and trips us and we're flat on our facues again. Wellllll, that's the general idea, anyway. Hmmmmm, fooled around here and now Karen is up and Rodney is contemplating it, so better sign off. Be a good kid now, and think about coming to see us next summer. We're letting you know plenty in advance, so don't say we didn't give you time to think about it. \n",

      "Mutt just went to work, twins are sleeping, Mark in the car bed playing with the exerciser the Dreges gave him (he sure loves that), and Karen is helping Mark play. Now you know all about us. The package came day before yesterday and you should see our little lady! She looks so sweet in her new nightie and struts around like a proud peacock. She says, \"Now we's both ladies, Mommie, because we got nighties and the boys haven't.\" She and her Daddy are going to fix those paper gadgets into a chain and use them on the Christmas tree, if we're not traveling. Sure hope they hold off with our transfer now till after New Years. Mutt is listed as \"surplus\" now in the 690th and it's a good thing because the squadron is being broken up and some sent to Gallup, New Mexico, some to Terra Amarillo, New Medico (way up in the mountains), and some to \"Cline's Corner\", New Mexico, east of here someplace and they'll be all gone by the 15th, so we missed that move. That's AC and W squadrons, though, still bouncing. We had a nice trip to Porterville. Mutt went to see Marie as she offered him a job at $400 a month plus a down payment on a home if he wanted to get out of the service and clerk in her off-sale liquor store, but we decided against it. War news wasn't so hot when we were thinking about getting out, but won't attempt it now that the situation in Korea is so bad. We wonder so much about the 606th squadron we were in at South Carolina. They're in Korea and we knew most of the men in the squadron. Majority of them married men with families, too. Had a birth announcement from Martha Cats a couple weeks ago and they have their second son. Her husband is in Korea. I feel thankful for every day that Mutt is here, because it will be just a miracle if he isn't sent overseas. Dread that time, but will cross that bridge when and if we come to it. Grannie sent the cutest white felt boots for Mark. Martha Cats sent him a gray and white romper and Doctor Bingham and staff sent a bath blanket and washcloth set. I wrote to Grannie yesterday and will get the other two letters off in a day or so. By the way, we might be getting an allotment check there again. It should be a nice $165. Our pay was pretty short this month as they're getting allotments started and there's always a mixup when they start that. Last November 30, 1949, they gave us $90 instead of the $400 Mutt had coming (in Alaska) and now they messed it all up this November 30. Bad time, just before Christmas for them to get mixed up, but that's life, I guess. I've been teasing Mutt that I'll be supporting him now because my allotment check is bigger than what he draws across the table on pay day. He was getting it all on payday till they started allotments, so it's just six of one and half a dozen of the other. Only difference is that part he gets and part comes in my name now. There were some changes made here while we were in Porterville. Our friend Marguerite made the sad mistake of hanging a man's white shirt and 2 t-shirts on the line one Sunday morning (day before we left for Porterville) and the landlord caught her at the clothesline and talked to her. He looked awful mad-like and she looked like the cat that ate the canary. When we got back, she was gone and we had new neighbors. There was a lady out there the afternoon we got back and I never saw her again, but figured maybe she just stayed in the house all day. Yesterday was cold and raw outside and I went out to empty some garbage about 4:30 and the two little girls were standing in the door of their house and the smallest girl was crying. I asked them if their mamma was home and they said, \"We don't have a mamma. She got killed.\" They were so cold they were just blue so I brought them over here till their Daddy came home. He leaves the gas turned on so the house won't be too cold, but the window in the door is broken out so it was pretty cold in there. Betty is 7 and Jean is 6. They have at least 10 blocks to school and have to walk home in the afternoons because their Daddy works and doesn't get home till 5:30 or 6. My heart just ached when I saw them standing in the doorway so cold, and ached a lot more when little Jean said, \"We don't have a mamma. She got killed\". They're good little girls and so well behaved. The older one seems so old for her age. She said her mamma was killed about two years ago and that their Daddy took care of them now. I didn't ask any more questions. Will make it a point though to watch for them after school and bring them in here till their Daddy gets home, though. They were so thrilled over Karen's dolls and doll clothes and all the kids had such a good time after they got acquainted a little bit. The boys are awake in there now, so better get them up and dressed. Karen has dressed herself, so that's done, and Mark just finished a bottle of milk, so he's happy. PS Did Daddy's birthday package ever get there?\n",

Also want to thank you for offering us a place to live if Mutt goes overseas, as we have talked about what I would do and frankly, I was stumped, so it is a big relief to know there are four walls and a roof over it that we can move into. Think it is just a matter of time till he will be sent over. Things sure look bad over there now and we do not have the manpower here to take many beatings like the 8th army is taking in Korea. We have wondered so much just where the 606th a.c. and West squadron is over there. That is the squadron we were in in South Carolina and they went over to Korea early last summer. We know a good share of them and then there is another bunch that went to Germany about a year ago and we know most of that bunch, too. Guess all our transferring has had its good points, too, as we missed those two places, temporarily, at least. Had a Christmas card from the Donaheys yesterday. She and Dayl, Junior, are home and Dayl Senior was to go overseas on a bomb test of some kind after Christmas, so suppose he is gone now. It is his first trip overseas. Dayl, Junior, started school this fall and Irene says he enjoys it so much. Also had a letter from Rachel Rounswall and they are still expecting to get sent back to the states. Their oldest boy started school this year, too. She said they had 16 inches of snow and it was 16 degrees below zero, mild, compared to North Dakota, is not it? That was written December 7, she said \"Scooter\" was worried for fear that Santa Claus would not know where to find Karen this year. Boy, I am telling you, those two (Karen and Scooter) fought like cats and dogs and the minute they were out of sight of each other they would wonder when they could play together again. We had our first snow here on New Years Day but it is almost all gone now. Karen swears up and down that it came from Alaska. Guess that is the only snow she remembers. We had a nice Christmas. She were going to wait till Christmas morning to turn the kids loose, but our curiosity got the best of us, so we got them up about 9:30 Christmas eve, soon as Santa Claus got the socks filled. They were so long-eyed and Rodney was scared to death of the little brown walking bears. We took some pictures of the kids, but they are not back yet. We had roast chicken for Christmas dinner. Our mouths had been watering ever since we got the letter from Helen saying they were sending one, but egads!! when we opened the package, it darned near knocked me over!! Boy, it was about the rottenest rotten thing I have ever smelled. She threw it out in the garbage and some little dog ran off with it. I saw him take it, but let him go, wonder if he deposited it on somebody's doorstep? Bet they got a big surprise if he did because it still had the paper on it and looked pretty good if you stayed out of smelling distance. We have been trying to figure out who drew our name for Christmas as we got gifts from both Sadie and Margie and such nice gifts. The lamp got here in A1 shape. Not a dent, scratch, or mark of any kind on it. The pictures had a corner off each one but I have the pieces and am sure I can fix them either with a little glue or scotch tape. They are sure pretty, anyway. We are going to get a toaster for our own Christmas gift but not till February as we had license plates to get this month. Was Santa Claus good to you folks? We wanted to get you and mom each a new briefcase but Sears did not have any in the store and knew if we ordered them by mail it would be Christmas 1951 before you would get them. Keep us posted on Frances, will you. We are anxious to know where he goes, when, and what branch of service. Guess the branch of service does not make much difference as they have all branches battling as \"fast\" soldiers in Korea. Mutt would prefer to go on a combat crew as he did during the last war, but naturally has not choice. We had a letter from Mappes (pilot of the crew Mutt flew with during World War II) and he is waiting for his call as he is in the reserves. She stopped to see him in Okie city when we drove through there enroute here. He has a Gulf service station and was doing a whole of a business. He married a red-headed nurse and they have two sons, Pat and Mike, about 2 and 4 years old, respectively. Did not meet his wife as she was helping out their family doctor while his office nurse was on vacation, but he took us over and showed us his two boys. Good looking little rascals, too. Well, Richard is yelling, \"Mommy\", so better get him up. Rodney and Karen have been up since 6 a.m. and Mark was awake about 4, so only have one lazy bug today. We have been trying like mad to train these boys, but think I will be doing good if they are out of diapers when they start high school!! Karen was so easy to train, but suppose it made a difference that she was all I had to fool with when I was training her. Must go! Hope you all have a Happy New Year!! It does not look too much as if it will be a very bright year, but you can never tell. Things never are as dark as they look, it seems. Love from us all, and take good care of the bossy Canns. Karen got such a kick out of your \"Ho Ho Ho\" message. PS This laid around till it is almost ancient history, but will send it anyway. Might be many moons till I get another one written. Think you are the only one I do not owe letters to now. \n",

      "Suppose you've given us up as lost, haven't you?? Wrote you and the Joneses a card to tell you we were moving on the base and this morning Papa Jones remembered he still had them stuck above the sun visor in the car!!  Now ain't that a man for you every time?? Have those kids here with a bowl of vegetable-beef soup in front of each one and they're so sleepy I don't know if they'll manage to eat it or not. They sure are growing. The climate is so dry here that their skin is just like shoe leather and chapped all the time. Sure is nice, though, as we can still slip a sweater on over their clothes and send them outside to play. We're so happy over our house on the base. We have two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bath, and a hallway. Lots of closet and cupboard space, hardwood floors throughout the house and inlaid linoleum on kitchen and bath. Also it is all furnished except curtains and living room furniture. They put in a new drop-leaf dining room table (in the living room, so new I had to tear the paper off it myself), new sideboard in the living room (I'd call it a buffet, but it's listed as a sideboard), and also two chairs and arms (in the living room). We're going to try to get curtains and a davenport payday. We've got wonderful clotheslines, 4 lines clear across the yard, also 2 swings in the backyard, so I know where to find Karen most of the time. The garbage is picked up daily and everything is so clean. There's a speed limit of 10 miles per hour all through the housing area so no worry about kids getting on the highway. Thing I like best, I believe, is that Mutt can come half hour at noon and also 15 minutes in the morning for coffee if he wants to. Sure breaks up the monotony of the day. Seemed like I never saw him enough to chat 5 minutes before, as he left at 6:45 AM and didn't get back till 4:45 PM and now he pops in here every once in awhile. Wouldn't feel a bit bad if they left us here for the next 10 years! By the way, they're going to set up a radar installation about 40 miles north of Devils Lake (Mutt checked on it and it's north of Devils Lake instead of north of Minot), but there won't be living quarters and such available till about a year from now. Here's the payoff, though!!! It is to be considered the same as Alaskan duty and the men who go up there even get overseas points same as the men in Alaska!! How about that??? They must think North Dakota is out of this world someplace. We could volunteer for it if we wanted to, and be almost certain getting it, but think we'll just stay put as long as we can. Wonder if they expect to go seal-hunting up there, too. It sure tickled me when I heard about giving men overseas points for going to North Dakota. Egads! What next!! Expect Mutt to pop in here any minute. He has to go to town to buy a tooth! He has a front tooth bridged in and it broke in half and fell out Friday. He looks about 50 years old now. (That is pretty old looking, isn't it, Mom?? Heh heh heh!) The twins' smallpox vaccinations are finally crusted so maybe they're on the downgrade now. They really had some potent reactions. Must have been new serum. Talk about cross kids!! Ooh!! If somebody had bid a fast nickel they'd have had a couple kids, I think. They're doing pretty well at their potty training now. They're soaked to the ears in the morning, but don't have many wet training pants and very rarely a dirty diaper. We \"pot\" them every hour and what's more, they refuse to sit down to wet now. Richard fights like a madman if you put him on the pot to \"biz\" and he hasn't \"stood-up\" first. Such characters! Mark is growing like a weed. He's got so much hair it feels like peach fuzz. It's about as long as peach fuzz, too! Oh, well, it doesn't matter how long he holds off getting hair, just that many less haircuts. He's been a very good baby and such good entertainment. He turns over now, and gets up on his knees once in a while, but hasn't gotten his shoulders up off the bed yet. Mutt drove by one of the hangars down here so I could see the B-36. Man, is that a huge thing. The tail of it stands as high as the hangar that the other plains are put into for repairs, etc. I don't see how anything that big can get off the ground, but it does. It's got 6 engines plus 4 jets, so it does have a lot of power. Mutt's heart's desire is to be a radar operator on a B-36, but so far they have just officers for that. Sure wish you could see that as it really is something to see. That's one thing about living on the base, you have free air-shows all the time. Yesterday afternoon there were 24 jets flying in formation right over the house, way upstairs, of course. By the way, could I send Grandma Fay's trunk back home? That trip back from Alaska to Seattle, to Michigan, then here just about finished it. It's a wonderful gadget when it comes to packing blankets and pillows and stuff, but it's just too old and it wouldn't take many more moves before we'd have to discard it and hate to throw it away when it's been in the family so long. Right now I think it would hold up till it got there (North Dakota) and would be fine to store stuff in as it's nice and clean on the inside, but if you don't want it, let me know and we'll hang on to it till it falls apart and then get ride of it. Let me know what you think we should do with it, though, will you, please? How are you coming with the Weber house? If you get a chance to rent it, go ahead. Daddy offered it to us to live in if Mutt should go overseas, but we don't want you to let it stand idle when you could be getting rent for it, as we're as undependable as the weather, you know. It wouldn't make us feel a bit bad if they'd forget about us for awhile. By the way, what happened to Mr. Weber, that put the house up for sale?? Last I heard of him, Mom said he was up on the roof fixing shingles. Did he fall off?? Well, another month and I suppose I can go into labor for Helen! The suspense of knowing how it all will turn out and what it will be darned near drives me goofy. Sure sweated out Lillian and Pat's deliveries. Seems like Fritzie's didn't worry me so much because I was home there with everyone else doing the worrying for me, but when we're way far away we have to worry about it all by ourselves. Am anxious to know how many it is, especially. Had a real good letter from Sadie. Now I owe everyone letters. Even had a letter from Aunt Vic. Must answer hers as it is the first one I've ever gotten from her. Have the round robin ready to mail. I've had it a month, so it's about time it got off. Gotta get going. Send us Frank's address, will you? Never know, our paths might cross. Well, you people way up there in that \"out of this world\" place, take care of yourselves!! If we get shipped overseas to Devils Lake, we'll let you know. Darned, if that isn't the funniest thing I've heard in a long time. Makes me chuckle every time I think of it!! Heh heh, foreigners!! That's what you are!!  PS We have a house address now, if you want to use it. Makes no difference. In case you come to see us you'll need it, though. It's 3522 Avenue A, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. There's mail delivery once a day here. Mutt'll get it at the squadron if it's sent there, so there's no difference where you send it.\n",

      "Meant to get this off to you sooner, but seems like I never finish what I start. In many \"little\" interrogations, alive two of them potted now, Karen is getting dressed and Mark has been fed and changed, so he is happy. Lil, if you can still use the snow suit, hang onto it. Looks like we will not b e going to North Dakota till April or May now as they are taking only single men and volunteers. Major Hardy (who is in charge of the North Dakota setup) is kinda sore at Mutt because he would not volunteer to go with the first bunch, but heavenly days!! It is too much of a risk for the twins to volunteer for it. Think they will be okay if we go in the spring and they spend the summer there, but to volunteer to go from this climate when they were sent here for \"health\" reasons, just would not make sense. They have not had a cold since we got here, so sure would like to stay awhile. Thanks for offering your furniture for us in the Steber house, too. That were mighty nice of you! Buttttttttt I told the folks to go ahead and rent it now, because next door had the same thing, but is okay now, too, so it must just last a couple days, whatever the \"bug\" is. I need a cup of coffee! Got the coffee pot on?? I was all enthused about moving next door to you and yelling \"coffee\" and see you and mom come running, buttttttt dern dream evaporated into thin air!! Had a letter from Frank last week. He was getting pretty excited over getting into finance, which was what he wanted. He said he had taken one day off and gone \"house or apartment hunting\" and found nothing. You know, Lil, this \"service\" life is not so bad. Matter of fact, it sorta gets in your blood after a while and you get itchy feet to move on to another location. One thing about it, though, you do miss being able to run over to see someone you have known all your life. True, you meet new friends all the time, but you rarely find what I would classify as a true friend. I guess that is mainly because, moving as much as we have, you just begin to know people by the time you move on. Do not get me wrong, though, we have met some wonderful people, and have friends scattered all over the globe now, but it is not quite like the friendship you have with people next door had the same thing, but is okay now, too, so it must just last a couple days, whatever the \"bug\" is. I need a cup of coffee! Got the coffee pot on?? I was all enthused about moving next door to you and yelling \"coffee\" and see you and mom come running, butttttttt dern dream evaporated into thin air!! Had a letter from Frank last week.

Egads! this is getting to sound like a sermon! Did not mean it to! Oh, by the way, Lil, I will hand onto those pinafores and dresses, till either you or I know where we are going so you will not have anything extra to pack when you go to Omaha. Jus cold for them now, anyway, and I have not unpacked them yet. Also have a couple little slips and some silk panties for her. Cannot see any sense in hanging onto things like that as we do not figure on having any more chilluns to wear them. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, so far, so good!!! Gosh, I have not written to Helen or Pat for so long that I am ashamed of myself, but we have been kinda busy trying to unpack, and with the kids on the bum it keeps us busy. Well, hope this gets to you before the snow unit gets mailed. Sorry I even mentioned it, but thought we would be joining you foreigners up in that ice-land. Till later, Love from us all, give Lil Becky a big love for us. Should love to see her walking. It is such a thrill, even when there are several others of your own that walked before, seems like the more there are the more you enjoy the baby!! \n",

      "Started a letter to you, couldn't tell you what happened to the first page of it, so will start again. We're having a lulu of a sandstorm. Like North Dakota blizzards, only dirt. Last Monday it hailed off and on all afternoon and the next day it was so mild I didn't even need a sweater when I hung clothes out, so we've really had a variety of weather. Mutt just took Mark down and got his second shot. Next month he gets his 3rd shot and his vaccination and that's that for him. The other three are all through with theirs. I've got a basket (with a heap on it) of ironing waiting for me, but thought I'd better get a letter off to you today as I'm going to start working 3-11 p.m. in the O.B. (no!! I'm not P.G.!!) ward at Presbyterian hospital in Albuquerqueerque, on Monday and suppose my correspondence will really lag then. Mutt gets off at 4p.m., so won't have to have a babysitter more than a couple hours. Correction: He's working 6-2, so won't need a sitter. He's definitely not going to be on the N. Dak shipment at all. The list of men going has come back to the squadron with Mutt's name scratched off. You see, when they put him up for re-assignment on Nov. 1st, he asked for a transfer to \"Strategic\" air command, so he'd get out of these bouncing a.c. kw. squads. He's never heard anything about it, but western air defense headquarters were afraid it would come through before they got him to N. Dak. and they'd have to find another man at the last minute, so just eliminated him to begin with. Karen sure is disappointed and keeps hounding me with \"when are we going to N. Dak to see Grandma and Grandpa Jay?\" Can't seem to convince her that we can't go now. Lavonne Temple (next door) and I took Karen and Bonnie (she's 5 1/2) to church Sunday morning. (Started for Sunday school but they'd changed the time, so it was over when we got there, so we took them into church instead.) We were a few minutes late, so waited in the hall, and Bonnie whispers, \"sure is quiet in there!\" Karen says, \"There's somebody saying something in there, isn't there?\" then we went in! The minister was in the midst of the sermon and Lavonne kept \"hush\"-ing Bonnie and pretty soon she says \"Shell, how come he can talk and I can't?\" Peace and quiet ruled again for a while and Karen suddenly decided to start counting pennies, so she starts \"plink, plink, plinking them in her purse and made sure she held them up high enough so when she dropped them into her purse, they'd make noise for her. I picked her up and put her on my lap and Lavonne put Bonnie on her lap. Next quiet spell and Bonnie pipes up with \"Shell, Karen can sit here all day if she wants to but I ain't!! I'm going to down to Sunday school!\" She got \"hushed\" again, and a little later church was over and we brought them home.\" Now at least once a day I hear, \"Is it Sunday yet?\" I asked her what she was going to do with all her pennies and she said, \"take them to Sunday school and buy groceries, and when I get back from Sunday school, I'm going to college!!\" \"Amen!!!!\" says me. Saturday p.m. Still finish this, so it will get mailed. Mutt just made a teeter-totter for the kids, so they'll be happy when they wake up. We have have to go downtown and get Karen some anklets so she can go to Sunday school in the morning too. We have a sick baby today. He woke up at 4:30 a.m. and I gave him aspirin and a bottle of milk and he slept a little then, but has fussed all morning. His temp is 102. They give the kids their shots in their buttocks instead of the arm. First time I've seen that done for immunization shots. It's 2 p.m. and he's sleeping now, so maybe he will feel better when he wakes up. Monday a.m. -baby 100% o.k. All is well. The men just put up our name plate in the front yard, so now all you have to do when you come to see us is find Avenue \"A\" and look for T/S st. F, E, Jone's nameplate. Had a letter from Mutt's folks. They plan to come and visit us in May. Mutt left for work at 5:40 this morning, and will be home at 2p.m. Have lots to do, so will sign off. We'll keep you posted on anything new around here, although we have high hopes of staying \"put\" for a while. Karen got a \"New Testament\" in Sunday school Sunday. She was so thrilled over it. She says, \"Is suppose to bring it to Sunday school \"ever\" Sunday, too.\"\n",

      "Just got Pat's letter saying Daddy was having trouble with his back, due to arthritis, to thought I'd get a few lines off to you right away, while the dishes soak in the sink and the kids get to sleep for their naps. Was wondering if you folks could come and stay with us till spring?? This climate is noted for it's relief of arthritic conditions and I'll be willing to bet money it would help your back, Daddy. There are still a couple months of cold weather up there which won't do any good for that arthritis and a couple of months in this New Mexico sunshine would likely do wonders for your back. I think Doctor O W would agree with that. Why don't you ask him and see. If it's as cold up there as the radio and newspapers here say it is, there probably isn't too much shipping now anyway. We'd sure love to have you come!!! Karen would go wild for sure, because she's still telling the kids in the neighborhood that \"Some day I'm gonna go see my Grandpa and Grandma Fay\". I'd still be working from 3 to 11, but Mutt could entertain you after 3, and we have a television set now too!! Will that help draw you?? Hog tie him Mom if necessary. One of the men in the 690th that got sent to Montana had it, and he'd have no use for it up there, so we got it for a little bit more than half what he paid for it and it was like new, as they have no children. It's a Philco and we sure like it. Karen gets a kick out of it too,  but it doesn't hold the twins's attention very long. By the way, Mom, the afternoon programs on television are mostly for women!! Just pack your suitcases, take Pop by the arm, catch the nearest plane and you'd be here in a few hours!! Simple, isn't it? The Trans World Airlines airport is just outside the base gate, so we could pick you up there if you flew in, or we'd pick you up in town if you'd come by train. I'd just bet that this climate for a couple months would really help you. Just let us know, will you?? And if you want to catch the next plane out without letting us know, do that and call Mutt at the 690th orderly room and they'll find him and we'll get you on the base!! We're serious about this, so think it over thoroughly and let us know!! One of the nurses at Presbyterian hospital has a husband who has an arthritis of the back and was sent here from Wisconsin and she said he was amazed at how rapidly he improved here. Got to get moving if I'm gonna get the dishes done and the kitchen cleaned up before I go to work. It's always spotless when I come home from work at 11, so I try to leave it that way, when I leave and Mutt takes over. Will be waiting to hear from you and hoping to see you. Tuesday, March 12. Gonna add a quick PS as it's 1:30 PM and I have dinner dishes to do yet. We are sending a package to you, Mom, for your birthday. Also stuck in a couple of bathrobes of Sandra's and Jim's that I used for Rod and Rich. Give them to Helen, please. Thanks. Received Helen's letter today. Was all excited because that darned Mutt read it first and said it was a girl!! Darn liar!! No time for more. \n",

      "I've got stuff that should be done, but feel like writing to you instead, so here goes!! First of all, for goodness sake don't worry about Richard's arm! It hasn't bothered him at all since a few minutes after he hurt it. The antics these kids go through every day would sure show up anything that might bother them, and he never favors it, so there's nothing wrong with it. The kids next door have a gymnasium set in the yard and the kids hold onto the bar and swing their feet, so if there were anything wrong with his arm that would surely bother him and it doesn't, so he's 100% O.K. Karen smashed her left hand in the car door Sunday night and thought she may have broken a bone in the back of her hand because it swelled up so fast, but she has good use of it. Her hand is still a little swollen and the back of  her hand and fingers are all purple, but it doesn't seem to bother her a bit. Funny how kids can get banged up and never seems to bother them. We're all waiting to hear the details of the little Monger girls. Gosh, I look at Mark and think \"Two younger than that\"!! That's quite a job for one person. Does Donita crawl yet? Mark walks around everything, but doesn't strike out on his own, as yet. He popped another tooth though, that's 7 now. Karen told Margie the other day that she was in love. Margie said, \"Who are you in love with? and Karen says, \"Hawkins\". Hawkins always says he comes to see Mutt, but I don't think it's Mutt at all, I think it's Maggie he comes to see. Karen's in \"love\" with him because he says \"Jesus loves me\" with her and he read one of her books to her, so she thinks he's really alright. Sadie and Margie went down to the service club to play the piano. Margie's fingers have \"piano itch\", I think.  July 20. Yes, and that was a couple days ago. Got Maria and Mona's announcement yesterday. Holy Moses!! What size would they have been if she'd gone another month!!  We have a set of 8 mos. twins in the nursery, one weighed 3 12 1/2 and the other 3 12 1/4 (Boy and Girl) and just expected to hear Pat's weighed about that. Suppose you've seen them by now. Do they have dark hair or blonde hair?? They aren't in the incubator, either, are they when they're that big? Last night we took the kids down to \"Playland\" and let them ride in the little cars, on an airplane, ponies, etc. and they really enjoyed it. We had driven by it one other night and Karen had been asking to go ever since, so we took them last night. Sadie and Margie didn't want to go, so went to the show at the theater here on the base. Day before yesterday they went to the service club to play the piano, so yesterday they left here early and went to town and bought a book of music. Came home long enough to change clothes and took off for the service club again. Got home about four o'clock and had supper, got dressed again and went to the show. Thursday is their day to howl as Sadie and I have the day off. Think it's been a little hard on them not to be able to go someplace every nite but don't believe it has hurt them any. They go to bed about 11:30 at night and sleep till 9 or 10 every morning, so they're getting plenty of sleep. They really make life interesting though. I'd forgotten how crazy teen-agers can be. I've been trying hard to get most of the housework done before I go to work so they won't go back with the feeling that all they got out of the summer was a lot of work and no play. They've gone swimming at the pool on the base several times, and to a ball game with Hawkins one evening and to the show here on the base and some in town, and they go to town any forenoon they want to, to shop and look around, so hope they don't feel the summer was wasted. They're sure a couple of good kids. Well, my brood is up, so guess I'd better quit. I got up at 6:15 to fix coffee for Mutt, so just stayed up while I was at it. It's 8:15 now. Mark has been fed, dried, and is sleeping again, so that's one down. Now, if I get the other three dressed, fed, and outside, all will be well. Have to go shopping for groceries, too. They've used 71 quarts of milk so far this month. Not bad, what if, heh heh heh, Sadie has put herself on a diet cuz she gained so much at first. No more room. \n",

      "Mutt just left for California with the car. The Charge Quarters came up about 10:45 with a message to call Marie. He went right down and called, and they said the doctors have given up on Mutt's mother and that the family was all sitting up with her tonight. That's all the information I got out of him because I packed his clothes and had a thermos of coffee ready when he came back and he took off. I feel badly about not going with him at a time like this, but Richard's temperature was 104 tonight at 8, so didn't dare start out with him. It's 99.8 now, but I've given him cool enemas, sponge baths, and aspirin to break the fever. Lieutenant Gibbs says it will be 6 weeks to 2 months for it to clear up. His neck is almost twice its usual size and he whines so in his sleep. Rodney had the same thing about 10 days ago, no more than that because it was when Sadie and Margie were here and he still has swollen glands and runs a temperature around 100.4 most of the time. It's almost impossible to keep them in bed, but that's where they're supposed to be kept. Karen and Mark are fine. This is short, but knew you'd want to know about Mother Jones. I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Mutt. Hated to see him take off alone, for fear he will drive too fast, but there wasn't any choice. \n",

      "It's 1 P.M. so I'll take a half hour and scribble a few lines.  Family all asleep and Pa Jones at work, so all is quiet, except for the radio blatting away.  Kids are almost over Pink Eye, so wonder what comes next?? A filling fell out of one of my teeth night before last and it was there when I went to bed and gone when I got up, so guess I \"et\" it.  Have an appointment September 27th to get it filled.  Had them check yesterday and I have a mouthful of fillings needed again.  Glad we don't have to pay for it.  Heavens I'll get off that lucky this time as they're getting pretty \"holey\".  I was lucky to get someone's cancelled appointment otherwise it would be November before I could get anything done.  Marge said something about Mrs. Crawford and Willard Anderson and then \"never know where cancer will strike next.\"  What's the story? Do they have cancer? Business is at a high peak at the hospital never got out of the delivery room except to wheel one out and another in all afternoon both Saturday and Sunday.  Didn't even get a chance to eat, it was just so confounded rushed.  We have a very  wealthy Jewish O.B. up there that took a fancy to me and wouldn't let anyone else do anything for her and darned near drove me crazy!! Every time she'd get a pain, she'd yell, \"Jonesieeeeeee\" and you could hear her all over the place.  That was Friday! If it had been Saturday or Sunday she would have just had to yell, \"Jonesie,\" but I practically specialed her Friday.  Sanders got quite a kick out of it and all the nurses aids would quietly moan \"Jonesie\" every time they saw me She's (the O.B) supposed to be an R.N., she says, and supt. of a hospital back in Indiana some place some time ago, but we all kind of doubt her word.  Also found she has a \"tendency to like her narcotics\", so have to watch that.  She was sposed to go home yesterday and I hope she did.  The night nurse found her pulling out her stitches because they bothered her!!! The darned fool!! Kinda wonder if she is trying to stir up an infection or something and then try to sue the hospital.  She wouldn't get very far, though, because she's been caught at too many things.  Almost forgot to tell you our baby is walking! Darned near breaks my heart cuz he doesn't seem like a baby any more.  Don't figure we'd better have any more, though, so he will just have to be our baby for a long time.  He thinks he's pretty smart now and gets so excited sometimes that he tries to walk nd giggles so that he falls down and has to start over again.  How are the little manger \"Putsies\"? Suppose they'll be walking by the time we see them.  Had our four all in the bathtub at the same time last night and my gosh! In another year, they'll look like quads.  Does Donita crawl yet? Or is she going to start right out walking. She's such a sweet baby.  Had a letter from Fritz yesterday.  She says Timmy still has his red hair and blue eyes.  Guess Bruceris pretty satisfied with his job.  Well it's 1:30 and my half hour is up so I hafto quit.  Sure enjoy your letters.  I owe Helen about half a dozen letters I think.  I'll catch up someday.  Bet she misses all her kids all day long or is she \"gadding\" now? Tell her she can come down here and see us any time. Gotta quit.  P.S. We have a telephone now. Our number is 7215 Kirtland A.F.B.  K.A.F.B. number is 3-7831, so all you do is ask for Albuquerqueerque 3-7831 and Kirtland will answer then ask for 7215 and the Joneses will answer.  O.K?? Might call you some Tuesday night.\n",

      "Wrote a few lines on duty, about a week or 10 days ago and that is as far as I got, so will try again. The twins and Karen are in the doghouse today. They got up at 6:30 and got a box of Oxydol and had it all over their room. Mad?? You guess! They got a licken they should not forget for years, and they are spending the morning in their beds. Think, that hurts worse than the spanking. We bought two double bunks (4 full size beds) and mattresses from the neighbors for $20.00 yesterday, and moved the kids in the big bedroom and put our bed in the small bedroom last night and had their room oft cleaned, even the floor scrubbed. Guess that's why the \"Oxydol\" made me so confounded mad. Got the kitchen scrubbed and our bedroom scrubbed too. The living room scrubbed up this morning, so now have the bathroom left. Last night we took Karen to the circus at the state fair and talk about a farce!! The only animals they had were some dogs and ponies. Admission to the fairgrounds were 50 cents each and then $1.00 each to the circus. We did not take the boys this year, but next year they should be big enough to stay awake. The \"circus\" was part of Karen's birthday present and she has talked \"elephant\" ever since we told her we would take her to the circus, so she was a little disappointed. We took her up in a big ferris wheel and her eyes almost popped out of their sockets, and then she rode the horses on the merry-go-round and had some cotton candy, so she was ready to come home after all that. Well, I have one more week to work at Presbyterian hospital and then I am going to work at the Santa Fe Hospital just a block down the street from Presbyterian. Found out I could work there and clear just as much every month and only work a five day week; so I took the job at Presbyterian. I clear $86.40 every two weeks and have Tuesdays off. At Santa Fe, I clear $86.35 and have Fridays and Saturdays off and that extra day means a lot to me. Miss Nebel at Presbyterian had fits!! but I gave her a two-weeks notice, so she has no reason to complain. She also said I could come back anytime, so that was nice to hear. Suppose you are in your new home by now, are not you?? By the way, tell Sadie and Margie that Sue Joffrion (next door with five children) got his orders for the Far East and they left for Texas last night. The baby is not two months old yet, and the oldest one is going to be eight in November. She sure has her hands full!! The Peguana's (Indians) across the street from us have moved too, so we will be getting two new sets of neighbors any day now. The little Joffrions fairly glistened last night, they were so clean.\" They were a cute bunch of kids and a nice family. Some of the 690th got transferred to Spokane, Washington, too, last week. Thought we might be going to see Fritz and Bruce, but we were not in on that bunch. Have a package here for the twins. also finally got some buttons and sewed them on the little dresses mom embroidered for my twin \"girls\", before they arrived, and will send them, too. Never had them on the twins at all and hope they are not too small for Maria and Mona. Gotta quit. P.S. appreciate your letters extra much because I know how hard it is to find the spare minutes with three little tiny ones.\n",

      "Will start this now and heaven only knows when I'll finish it. Aunt Martha, Uncle Bern, and Baba were here from Sunday P.M. about 3, until about 10 yesterday morning. I caught the 2:30 bus to work, so didn't see very much of them, but it was so good to see somebody from home, even for a little while. Mutt got supper for them Sunday night, and then they all came to the hospital after me at 11 o'clock. They hit us at a pretty good time, because I was off duty on Saturday and had washed the walls in the bathroom and scrubbed everything good in there and also the kitchen floor, waxed the floors and part of the woodwork and got the curtains in both the bathroom and kitchen washed and up again and Mutt had cleaned the stove and washed the cupboard doors and the sink and all that stuff, so it looked fairly presentable here. I was to have both Friday and Saturday off last week, but I just started on Thursday, and then was to have it all by myself on Sunday and Monday and there are 40 patients on 3rd floor and I didn't feel that I could do it justice with only being there one day, so I worked Friday, too, and I got along fine Sunday and Monday. There will be two of us on from now until Friday. I sure enjoy Santa Fe Hospital better than Presbyterian. It's not nearly as nerve wracking here. Oh, by the way, Mom, one of my patients (Doctor Williamson) is a retired Army Colonel and used to work with Uncle Gus when Uncle Gus had charge of the Air Force Medical supplies at Washington, D.C., and he also knew the two Colonels who were in charge of the hospital when I worked at Marchfield. Sure is a small world, isn't it? Doctor Williamson is one of Santa Fe Railway's head surgeons here. He had surgery himself about a week ago. Darn it, it's 11:25 so will have to quit for this time. Will add some more another day. Monday, October 22. Will try again. Just got the kids outside and it's 10:15. Karen wanted to be \"Mama\" this morning, so I let her. She got breakfast (cereal, cookies, oranges, and milk) and set the table while I put the twins' shoes and socks on them and got Mark changed. She even put the milk on the Wheaties and the Wheaties were really swimming, but everybody ate them, anyway. She let me be \"Momma\" long enough to make a pot of coffee, though. Then after we got through eating she pipes up with, \"Now let me tell you what I want Santa Claus to bring me. I want dolls and dishes and brooms and stuff so I can play house.\" Maybe there was a motive behind her getting breakfast! We had such a nice weekend this week. I had Friday and Saturday off and we just spent the whole two days fooling with the kids, and doing not much of anything. That extra day sure makes a difference. It gives us both a good rest. When I had one day off a week, it seemed like that day was more active than the days I worked, and we never got to bed any earlier. We went out to look at a new Housing area they've built (between Sandia Base and Kirtland) and it's really nice. We could get a 2 bedroom house for $68.00 and we pay $85.00 here, but there are no telephones and the only furniture in them is a stove, refrigerator and washing machine. They have much bigger rooms, and the livingroom has a big picture window, and they're all tile floors. People are moving out there like mad, but think we will just stay put!! Well, gotta get dinner, so will put a stamp on this and put it out for the mailman. Sure enjoyed our telephone gab session. I had tried to call you back and had gotten Rugby, when another operator interrupted and said they had my call from Rugby on another line, so finally got it. Karen was so thrilled that she talked to Gramma. \n",

      "Have the youngsters all up at the table, so while they eat, I'll scratch a few lines. Then I can dress them and shoo them all out. I had 8 pages written to Helen that I started November 1 and it was almost a diary. I'd added a few lines on duty one evening and forgot the letter and someone threw it away!!! Made me mad, because it takes forever to get a letter finished, it seems. Nobody's fault but my own, though, for forgetting it there. November 29, 1 PM. Kids in bed, dishes soaking, Pa at work, little ironing done, hair pinned up, etc etc etc etc. Got lots of news and don't know where to start. First of all, Technical Sergeant Jones no longer is!! He's Master Sergeant now!!!!!!! As of November 24. We were all hopped up about that and he was just promoted from squadron AC and W supervisor to district AC and W supervisor and we were all excited over that! Then Monday noon, he came home to tell me he was on an overseas shipment for the Far East (Japan, Korea, Okinawa or such place) and sailing date was January 6!! Sick???? I thought our whole world had fallen apart!! Yesterday we got a little encouragement when we found out that 34th Air Division had sent a letter asking that Mutt be taken off the list as he was the only qualified \"70\" (whatever that is) in this area and that he has 53 overseas points while most of the men here have 20 to 22. They said they were sure he'd be taken off, so we have our fingers crossed. Would go to Porterville if he has to go overseas, because Rodney is already coughing and has a little cold and the weather is just cool enough now to wear sweaters instead of coats and am afraid he wouldn't survive North Dakota winters. There's a little 2 bedroom house next to Dad Jones' that Marie owns and said we could rent if Mutt went over, so guess that's where we'll go, if we have to, which we don't think we will now. We're sure hoping, anyway. We got the package and it was just like early Christmas here!! Mutt hasn't used his pot holders yet, but has worn the socks and I've worn both the socks and apron. Everybody enjoyed everything. Kids enjoyed the candy most. Karen's Sunday School teacher called me this morning at 7:45 and said she'd picked Karen and was going to get another little girl and a little boy and the three of them have the welcome for the Christmas program. She said she picked Karen because her face was so \"expressive\" and that she picked up things so fast in Sunday school that she thought it would be easy for her to memorize. The older children are giving a Christmas play and the little ones have \"pieces\" to say. Have some of our Christmas shopping done. By the way, what size shirt do you wear, Daddy? Won't tell you what you're getting but what size shirt do you wear?? Have your birthday present here and will send it in the Christmas package. Now, somebody please tell us what Mamma Mia would like. Any broad hints???? Gotta quit. PS Tell Helen Mutt said the only bad thing about him making \"Master\" was that Helen would probably demote him to Staff Sergeant next time she writes. One time she demotes him to staff, and then she'd promote him to Master and then maybe next time he'd be down to Technical again. Every time a letter comes from her, he says, \"Well, what's my rank this time? Am I promoted or busted!\" Got to quit.\n",

      "It is 10P.M. and all is quiet. Everyone in bed for the night. Santa Claus came to our house yesterday, and brought a North Dakota pkg. Boy, was there excitement!! Do not know who got the biggest kick out of it, the kids or us. Karen's dress fits like you had had her there to measure it and is she proud of it!! I took her to the beauty parlor today to get her hair shaped and I let her wear her new dress and she told everybody that \"my grandma made this dress for me.\" It looks so nice on her. The twins have not tried on their new clothes yet, but they \"held them up\" and they look like they will be just right, appreciate the bell on Mark's coveralls. Now we can \"hear\" where he is. The rugs are down by the kid's beds and Mutt said they all said their prayers last night. Good kids, are not they?? December 29th Page 2 of the daily diary! That's probably what it will turn out to be before I am through. It is 4 P.M. and the kids are still napping. Mutt and Bernie (from across the street) are putting linoleum down in the bathroom. Those \"kids\" have more fun!! They cut the hole too big where the toilet goes and there is one of them on each side of it now trying to \"piece\" in the gap! It will be nice when they are through, though. Junie is a carpenter in the 690th Squadron, and his wife (Florence) is the gal that loves our Mark so much. She took the Christmas tree down and packed all the Christmas decorations away for another year. Next Christmas we will use the \"nativity\" scene you sent. It sure is nice. It looks so peaceful in the living room again. She were all thrilled to get the tree up and really enjoyed it but the needles were falling pretty bad, so we took it down. Found the L.J. Drege's Christmas card, too, when we were putting things away. I will fool them and mail it anyway! Early for 1952!! The sand has started to blow again. It always does right after I get everything dusted. She will have lots of sand from now till spring, though Mark got a \"football\" from Randy Shuler. It is a real one only about 1/3 as big as the regular size one and the cutest darned thing. Should like to ace those two little men at a game of football. Donita could keep score for them! Mark just got up, so I imagine they will all be up pretty soon! That puts an end to this when they do. She had fried chicken for Christmas dinner ate turkey on Thanksgiving till it came out over dark, so switched to chicken for Christmas. I worked the 18th and 19th and then again the 26th, 27th and 28th and that is all till the 15th and then I go back on the regular 3.11 shift with Sundays and Mondays off. (at Santa Fe Hospital) Now Rodney's up and the other two are squirming so they will be next. Had a Christmas card from Sibyl. She is expecting a daughter (she hopes) on February 8th. Louis Gene goes to kindergarten. He was five in November. Louis still works for Santa Fe Railway at San Bernardino and they bought their own home about a year or more ago, so they should be sitting pretty good right now. Had a card from Mrs. Gene Sch., too, and she said Gene was still in North Dakota. Forgot to mention that if Daddy's shirt doesn't fit, send it back here and we will exchange it. Got it at sears. They had a pipe we wanted to get him at the Px, but could not quite see our way clear. It was a $25.00 meershaum (special??) and was a crooked stemmed one, but maybe on Father's Day or something we can get it. Hear you are to lose some weight, mom? Think if you carry that purse downtown once a day you will lose 10lbs a week!! It sure is heavy, but bet it will never wear out!! Intended to get some more aprons made, but never got that far. Maybe next year. Still have not unpacked the trunk. Do not even know for sure what I have in it but not going to unpack it unless I find something missing that I have to have. It will probably show up in there!! Well, must close for this time. Gotta get supper. By the way, we have a son that takes forever and a day to eat! seems like we just cannot hurry, Richard!!!!!!! Ever hear of a similar case if \"Hurry\" \n",

      "Good morning! Parma drinking coffee and eating donuts, kids in bed and all is quiet. Guess what! Santa Claus came to our house again! This time on Dec. 31st. Sure was nice that your package came a little later than the rest. Think the kids enjoy each pkg. a little more when they don't get here all at once. Karen's blouse fits to a T, and she's worn that white slip ever since she got it! Hope to get it off her on wash day. The kids all sat right down on the floor and played \"cars\" with Rodney's cars and our little dummy rand around shaking the dumbell! I was in the midst of washing when the pkg. came and Karen came lugging it out to the clothesline yelling \"Look what we got, Mommie! He did it again!\" I said, \"Who did what again?\" and she says, \"Santa Clause! He sent us another pkg!\" 9:30 A.M. The kids all got up, so had to quit. Mark has cried ever since he got up, so he's in bed, mad as a hornet! Got the kids room dug out again this morning, and was just starting on our room and decided to put him to bed. He sleeps in a lower bun and unless I sit there for 5 or 10 minutes till he's asleep, he gets up and takes off. He would sleep later in the mornings, but when the other three get up, he hears them and is up, too. Just gave the kids the last of the box of cookies you sent, so they're having a party in the back yard. It's a little chilly this morning, but would probably feel warm to you. We got a pleasant surprise New Years day. The Rounsavalls, who lived in the duplex with us in Alaska called and were down on the highway, so I told them how to get out here and they were out here by 10 A.M. and left the next nite about 8 P.M. Sure enjoyed their visit and they had so much news from Alaska about people that we knew. They're going to be stationed at Merced, Calif., not too far from Mutt's home. One of the Sgts we knew up there (Sgt. Arid) committed suicide, they said. His wife and little girl came up to Alaska shortly after we did (in Mar. or April) , and we lent them dishes and stuff so they'd have something to use till their stuff got there, but she and the little girl only stayed a week and then took off for the states again. We heard later from one of the women that had come up on the boat with her that she had a boy friend who had come all the way from Wisconsin to Seattle and saw her off on the boat at Seattle and had said he'd see her in a couple weeks, so she apparently had no intention of staying in Alaska. He, Sgt Arid, seemed like a nice fellow and was about 23 or 24 yrs. old. I had only seen him a couple times, once when they brought the crib, dishes, and stuff back and he looked like he'd lost his best friend then. Never know what this old world holds in store! Wonder how she feels about things now?  Ye Gots and little catfish! Got Mark asleep and heard Rodney yelling like he was killed. He'd gone next door and turned on the water faucet on the outside of their house and then fell backward in nice, icy, cold water! He's had his licken now and is sitting by the heater getting warm. Don't know why they turn the water on over there all the time. They never bother our faucet out there and they been blistered a dozen times for turning on the neighbor's water but at least twice a week they have to try it again, then get their bottoms warmed thoroughly and in a couple days, right back for another whipping! Think they have rocks in their heads. Had a long juicy letter from Sadie yesterday. Sure enjoyed it!! I'm going back to work the 1st of January, so suppose that will end the letter-writing again. It's almost impossible to find the time then, because my days are long, but just not long enough to get any letter-writing done. Too many other things that must be done. We have hopes that maybe after June we can see our way clear without me working. Should bet money though, that we won't be here that long. They're taking A.C. and W. men out of here by the handful!! Mutt has just 45 men left now, and he did have around 150, just a short while ago, so imagine we'll \"get the ax\" pretty soon. Am so glad we go to have Christmas to-gether, anyway. Then, too, I've enjoyed all the time we've had to-gether the past 3 wks. Haven't gotten a heck of a lot of extra stuff accomplished, but we've enjoyed wasting time, anyway. Gonna sign off and will add some more to this some other fine day, I suppose. Mailman just went by, sooo this won't be mailed till Monday, anyway. By the way, I found a sealed letter here, I had addressed to you, and have a hunch it's your Christmas card, so I'll mail it anyway and then you let know what it is, will you? Thanx.  Jan. 8, 1952. Will bid you good morning and good-bye and quit! Mutt is supposed to fly to Roswell, N. Mex. on another inspection trip this morning so we slept a little late this morning. He usually goes to work at 6, but his plane leaves at 7:45 this morning so we didn't get up till 6. The kids have themselves almost dressed. The twins can't put their shoes on yet, but can dress themselves except for shoes. Sometimes they get their shirts on upside down and their pants inside out, but they try, anyway. Karen is pretty good at helping them if she's in the mood! Sometimes they're just plain nuisance, she says, and comes to me and says, \"Mommie, the boys are aggervating me.\" I tell her she might as well get used to it, cuz that's what little brothers always do and she says, \"Don't they ever be big boys\"\" Hear a plane warming up on the runway. Bet it's our Pa in it, too. Have a Happy New Year!  \n",

      "It's 1:25, I catch a bus at 2:30, and I have dinner dishes yet to do, so this will be short. Received Margie's letter yesterday, that Grammie had a stroke and is in a coma. So glad Helen could go with you, but can't see my way clear to go. Have no place to leave the kids, and we don't have enough furlough time accumulated to get up there and back. Keep us posted, though, will you. January 23, 10 AM. Some fellow came to check the houses for roaches and mice, so had to quit. Business is sure steady around here. There are inspectors of some sort or other that show up at least once a week. Sure keeps me hopping. The hospital is full to overflowing, too, so no time to write any letters on duty, either. Sandia Corporation called me again, so I went over to see them, and they gave me some more papers to fill out. Had to give every consecutive address I've had for the past 15 years. Ended up with a list of 49 addresses. Thank heavens for our family scrapbook, as I have every house number except one in there. They have to type up 7 copies of it, so they'll love me when I take that list over for them. Also have 3 references which the security men will check and gave Cora Crook, Elmer Emerson, and Josephine Stennes, so the FBI will probably be up to see them. There's a lot of red tape to go through but it's a darned good paying job, $76.10 a week. There's one other girl who has her application in, too, and she's a friend of the doctor out there, so she'll probably get the job but figured it wouldn't hurt to turn in the information they wanted, anyway. I get $230 a month where I am now, but they take out $15.84 for hospital retirement, which you don't get back unless you retire at 65 years of age and they take out $4.50 for hospital, which I don't need as we get GI medicare, so they don't pay as much as it appears to be. Sure enjoy the work, though, as it's such a variation of cases. Got Helen's letter yesterday too. Sure glad she got to go with you. It's her first trip to the West Coast, isn't it? Mark got new shoes yesterday and is so busy admiring them that he's got his forehead all bruised up from looking at his feet instead of watching where he's going. Florence Owens (from Manchester, England) just came in and she and Mark are wrestling while I finished this up. Karen was sitting on my lap chattering this morning about when she got big like me she was going to go to work with me. I told her I'd be an old woman and a grandma like Grandma Fay and Karen says, \"Grandma Fay's not old, she's just got a nice, big tummy!\" Gotta quit. We're eating dinner at 4:30, so better get started. Give our love to all the folks in Oregon and thereabouts. PS Still on your 800 calorie diet, Mom???\n",

      "Will get a few lines off before the brood gets up. Karen and Rodney have been up and I put them in our bed so they would not wake the other two up and they are highly insulted because I made them go back to bed. Cruel, cruel, mother!! Was sorry to hear of grammie's death, but in another way it was a blessing. If she had lived through that last stroke she would have been an invalid completely and poor little earil would not have been happy with a life like that. She sure was a sweet little old lady though, and the youngsters enjoyed her so much this summer. They have been pretty hard hit on grandmas in the last few months. Six months ago they had three grandmas and now they have just one. Karen says that grandma Ledfors can go up to heaven and help grandma Jones take care of God and Jesus.\" She expect grandpa Jones to come and see us this spring sometime. He is planning to drive back to Arkansas then to see his brother, \"old uncle Jimmy\". Grandpa Jones has been under medical care, too. His blood pressure was up to 190, but is down to 150 now and he says he feels better except that he gets sooo lonesome. There is not much news from this territory except that the 690th AC squadron is now the 135th a.c. and W. squadron. Nothing different, except now I have to get the squadron numbers straight again. I just get straightened out and Bingo! they change again. The base here has been quarantined for a few days with an epidemic of strep throat. Grammar school, nursery, theatre, cafeteria, and all eating places except the mess halls have been closed and all unmarried R.N.'s restricted to the base. Also a couple cases of measles in the block, but so far so good here. Mutt rented a floor polisher Sunday and worked and polished the living room, kitchen, bathroom and hallway and I did the bedrooms yesterday morning, so we are pretty shiny around here. It is all gone again in 3 or 4 days, but it looks better, temporarily, at least. Karen has learned to joint her name and drives us out finding letters of her name on the milk bottles, bread wrappers, cereal boxes and everything else that has any writing on it. Of course Rodney and Richard paint, too, and say \"Dat my name, mommie,\" and it is usually a \"5\" or something!! Several of the little girls around here go to school and on Saturdays they conglomerate and play school. Karen wanted to write her name, \"like Shirley Jones,\" so I printed it on a little blackboard and she printed the letters under those I had printed, and yesterday she came in the kitchen and said, \"watch me write my name, mommie.\" She usually gets all five letters on the board, but it reads \"KNRAE\" or some such combination, but she has them straight now. Lightening just struck in the bedroom. They are up  in there now and Karen just got in trouble. Richard came out and said, \"Janna put in me eye, mommie.\" I asked her what was going on in there and she said, \"Well, mommie, Richard is agarvating Rodney and me, so I spit in his eyes.\" I proceeded to give her a lecture on \"spitting\" and she says, \"well, mommie, one day you said, \"If you do not get out of the kitchen and leave me alone, I will spit in your eye\" now I spit in Richard's eye\" They are just like elephants; they never forget! Boy, they teach me things, new things everyday!! Found another man at the hospital that reminded me of Daddy. His name is \"Blair\" no, not Stanley Blair. He was sitting on a bench in the hall, had one foot up on the bench and he was sitting there \"thinking\" like Daddy does and was running his fingers through his hair, just like Daddy does when he is \"thinking\", and to top matters off his hands are like Daddy's. He is getting surgery done on one hand to get his fingers straightened out. He has had an injury on the palm of one hand and he cannot straighten his fingers out straight. Anyway, I told him that he reminded me so much of my Dad that if I saw him very much, he was going to make me homesick. What did he do?? He wrinkled up his nose (like Daddy does when he is about to put forth a bright remark) made a face at me and said \"Well, if I remind you of your Dad, I will tell you one thing! you have not got the prettiest Dad in the world!!\" I told him, \"Oh, yes, he is! In my eyes, he is the \"prettiest Dad in the world\", and now he comes up on 3rd floor (he is a patient on 2nd floor) every day and always stops to pass the time of day, and darn! He even talks like Daddy!! Whenever he is talking about one of the nurses, he refers to us as \"that little girl.\" He is about 60 or there abouts. The kids just announced that they are hungry, so I had better sign off. Gonna wash clothes this morning, too so better get started. P.S. Daddy's card took 6 days to come from Oregon. Is not that, speedy?? \n",

      "We're leaving on a 10 day furlough to Porterville. Dad Jones in critical shape. Has had 3 heart attacks in past 2 days. We should get there Sunday or Monday night. He's at Windy's so send any mail to Route 2, Box 444-X, Porterville, care of WM Jones. Will keep you posted. PS Will be back here the 17th. Sure hope we get there in time.\n",

      "Just got Mutt off to work again and the kids in bed for their naps, and I am gonna steal a few minutes and have a chat with you. It is a beautiful day today. Too warm for a sweater and there is a nice cool breeze and everybody is outside spading and planting stuff. Well, ten men in this area were promoted to the same \"MOS\" as Mutt's (27370) and Mutt has the most overseas points of all, so it looks like we can breathe again, as far as overseas is concerned, anyway. As far as transfers go, wire always eligible for that, but long as we can keep our clan together, we do not dare complain. Yesterday was such a dreary day. It was windy and chilly all afternoon and Mutt had C.Q. (Charge of quarters) from 8a.m. yesterday till 8 a.m. today then works his regular shift till P.m. and then if off till Wednesday mornign at 6.00 He has got an infected eye today, so we are putting Boric acid ointment in that and he looks like a pirate, with that eye patch on. The doctor said it was a climatic condition. This is \"sand storm\" time and he said there were lots and lots of people coming in with their eyes like that. They get inflamed and swollen and itch. It is not pink eye and is not contagious, thank heavens! Richard goes to the clinic at 7:00 or 7:30 a.m. Wednesday to get the stitches out of the back of his noggin. He fell off Karen's bunk and had to have a couple stitches taken, at 6:45 a.m, mind you!! I heard a thud in their bedroom and then heard Karen say \"Lorkit the blood!!\" and I was in there like a shot. It bled beautifully and he had reached back to feel it and smeared blood all around his neck and face and it had run down his back and legs and I thought he must have been gashed to bits. By the time I got him washed off, all I could find was a little gash 1/2\" long at the back of his head. It gaped a little so they took the stitches and he never even yipped! Winced a little as the needle went through, but did not cry. The doctor told him he was a good boy and now everytime I tell him to behave himself he replies, \"the dotto say me dood boy!\" If I go to spank him he says, \"Do not pank me, mommie, the Datto say me dood boy!\" Before I forget it, thanks for the green stamps, mom, and the memorial of grammie. No, I do not save the other stamps. We had a letter from Dollie again and she said Dad Jones is slowly improving. It takes six weeks of bedrest for that, and then very slowly get them up 2 hour a day for a while and gradually increase it till they can get around without any pain or shortness of breath. Do not believe I have ever seen anyone so close to death's door and still get out alive. We got the cutest picture of the monger \"triple troubles\" and their Daddy. Wish we were close so I could hold the little \"doubles\" awhile. Did not seem to have time to enjoy holding my own when they were little. Mark went for a walk this morning. Tried to join the air police but guess they decided he was a little young and sent him home to grow up! He had been out in the back yard and disappeared. I looked high and low for him and when I got back to the house, here he comes walking along beside an air police and the Air Police said he walked into the Air Police Pass office and stood there chattering to them, then of them started walking with him and he showed the Air Police where he lived! We are less than a block from the Air Police gate, but it is the first time he ever strayed over there. The Air Police asked Mark, \"Is that your, mommie,\" and Mark replied, \"Uh huh,\" so I got him back again. Wheeeeee, the mailman is due by here any minute, so I had better get this in an envelop or it will not go till tomorrow. By the Margie, Karen said the other day, \"When it is swimming time, is Margie coming to take me swimming\" How about it?? I told her she would have to write and ask you, so she wrote you a letter, but I never mailed it. Do not know where it is now. It was a page a scribbling with her name at the bottom, so all you could read was her name, anyway. Oh, yes, found the Easter card I was ready to send you folks last Easter, but had written a letter on the back and dated it, so will have to splurge on some new ones this year!! Heh, heh! Heh, still have L. Drege's Christmas card, too. Boy, I am right up to bar, I am!! P.S. Happy Birthday mom and Mugs!! There will be a package coming if I ever get my shopping completed. Were waiting to get to Juarez to get Margie a Mexican jacket, but will have to let that go this time and get something else. P.S. II For the twins' birthdays?? anything but Crayons, please!! They have got a good sized sack full of them that one of the neighbors gave them when they were transferred, and they got them out one day while we had a baby sitter and they colored window sills, foot lockers and everything else, so they are off crayons for awhile!!\n",

      "Got a letter from my little Maggie today, but will write to you tonight and then to her tomorrow night. Well, tis 31 years you two have been hitched. You know you really have accomplished a lot in those years. It's some job to raise a family as big as yours is and especially to give us all an education, too. Think you have every reason in the world to feel pretty proud of yourselves. Wonder if any of us will do nearly as well with our families as you have done with yours. 31 years seems like a long time, but when you stop and realize you have raised a family of seven, given them all the education they wanted, kept them well clothed and well fed, have seen 5 of them married, and a whole gang of grandchildren pop up, it must have been a mighty full 31 years. What it all boils down to is that we send our congratulations to you both on a job well done, and we just love you an awful, awful lot and hope you have many, many more happy years together. Would like to have been there with you, but such is life. We really had a cloudburst last night. They had the CAP out getting people out of homes that were flooded, and most of them worked till early morning. I'll send you some pictures out of the morning paper if the paper isn't gone by the time I get home. Also have some snaps of the kids taken at Easter that I will put in. The one of Mark on his hands and knees I snapped while he was playing \"dog\" and barking at his daddy. Kids sure grow fast, don't they? Can't figure out how kids keep growing up and our parents never seem to get any older. Am so glad Frankie is going to get to go to OCS this fall. Personally I think the service is just the place for him, and bet he will do well at it, for the simple reason he can't quite if he gets mad, and he's at the right age to go on up the ladder. Gosh, I'd just love to see their girls and the Monger girls. Time goes so fast and their only little once. (Sorry, teacher, I got the wrong \"their\" in there). We don't have any babies at our house any more. Darned little Mark didn't stay a baby long enough. Matter of fact, he's the toughest little devil in the block and will tackle anybody or anything. Sure love the little demon, though. Mutt is going to Porterville for Father's Day if everything goes as planned. From the sounds of the letters from there, he's not doing too good again, but he would be able to visit, anyway, if Mutt went out now. He plans to leave Saturday morning before Father's Day and Sergeant Prottengeier and wife and little boy are going to come out Monday and stay till he gets back, so there will be somebody there with the kids when I'm at work. They're from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The name doesn't sound \"Swede-like\", though, does it, Mom. Will take time out and call my family. They all have to talk when I call, but Karen always has the most to say. Well, no news tonight. Jut got them on the line and got a patient in so had to hang up. THey'll be in bed before I get around to calling again, so will have to let it go tonight. Well, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna sign off for this time and one of these days I'll write again. At least in time for your next 31st anniversary. \n",

      "Got your long juicy letter just before I came to work and read it so fast, I forgot what all it said and forgot to bring it with me, but will write a letter to you now, anyway, and then add to it when I get home if I've forgotten anything. By the sounds of things you've really been busy again. Makes me mad sometimes the way the city and county expect you to take charge of everything that needs a leader. I know you're a darned good leader and capable of anything they can fire at you, but if they don't quit demanding so much of you, they're going to make a nervous wreck out of you and ruin your health as well. There are other people that could do a few of those things if they just had the backbones to get up off their rear ends and do some of that stuff instead of just saying, \"Let's call Mrs Fay, she'll do it\"! They know you're a big-hearted woman and hate to turn them down and sometimes I believe they work on your sympathy till you can't say \"no\". This isn't a lecture, Mom, it's just that I can't see how you do it. All that mental strain of reports to get in and all that stuff that has to be done on a certain day, at a certain hour, is much harder than actual physical work. You're all the Mom we've got and the only Grandma we have left and I couldn't stand to see you end up with ill health \"for the good of the city or the good of the county\". I think you need to get away from Rugby awhile and let them percolate without you. It'd be good for them and you, too. Matter of fact, we've been wondering if there'd be any chance of you coming back with rank and Lil when they come back from furlough, and then come to see us for a couple weeks or months. You don't have anybody in school now and we'd just love to have you here. Seems like ages since we've seen you. Don't suppose Daddy could come now, as it sounds like he's shipping quite a bit of stock and when you've got a living to make, you have to make it where and when you can. He must get awfully worn out riding that cattle train all those miles every week. I'm afraid I'd just crawl in a real bed and sleep my days away between trips if I had to travel that far every week on one of those trains. We hit one like that when we went from Texas to South Carolina and holy Moses we were sore all over from the jerking and stopping of that train. They just had coaches, no pullmans, and the backs of the seats were straight, like on the \"Hong Flyer\". Thought my back would break. I was young, too, so it must be pretty rough on Daddy riding those things. However, if Daddy could come, too, we'd even be tickled pinker!!! Mutt just called me and Mark has a temp of 103 degrees. Karen blossomed out with the mumps on Sunday, so suppose that's what he's getting, too. One consolation is that their bedroom is the coolest in the house and they don't mind being put to bed in there. Karen was fussing so for \"something to do\", so I gave her an American magazine, some scissors and safety pins, and told her she could cut out all the pretty pictures and pin them to the blanket on her bed. She frowned and said, \"That doesn't sounds like fun\". I told her that Grandma Fay did that for Aunt Fritzie when she had scarlet fever only she pinned them on the curtain. Boy, her eyes lit up and she said, \"Did Grandma Fay really do that?\" I told her \"yes\" and by golly she started \"cutting\" and has been at it all day yesterday and all forenoon today!! Happy as a lark, too. She's swollen on both sides, but doesn't have any fever. Suppose the twins will get it, too. Mutt has had it on one side, so he thinks he's immune. I told him that Daddy got it when he had news of his first grandchild, so Mutt had better not feel too sure of his immunity. We'll try to be through with the \"mumps\" series before you come, Mom. See, I've already convinced me that you'll come and see us. How and I doing about convincing you?? Mutt says if I don't get any results, then he will write and try his luck. I have Saturdays and Sundays off and Mutt says we could leave early some Saturday morning and go to Holbrook and see Uncle Cliff. We'd have to leave again Sunday night but could spend all day Sunday there, anyway. He's being transferred to 34th Air division here on the base as an instructor, so would have to be back for classes on Monday. Mutt got back Friday night about 6:30 PM and really enjoyed his visit out there. His Dad is much, much better. He went through the clinic and the doctor told him his heart is in perfectly good condition. There's a tiny scar on his heart, but the doctor said if Dad Jones hadn't told him how sick he'd been he'd never have known it, by the looks of his heart now. Told him he could do anything he felt like doing, including driving his car and going fishing, so he's one happy man. To top matters off, he and old Dad Stamper left to drive back to Porterville last Thursday, by themselves, mind you, with Dad Jones driving!! Marie gave Mutt a ring that she had given Mom Jones years ago and it's mine now and is to go to Karen when I'm old and decrepit. It's a jade, oval-shaped, and has 31 chip diamonds around it, set in platinum. Sure is a pretty thing. Marie and Dad are driving back to Arkansas this fall and are going to spend a few days with us en route. I get so lonesome for \"relatives\" sometimes that I'm tempted to pack up and go visiting, but we can't do that whenever we get the urge or we'd probably be visiting most of the time. Time out for a sandwich! I'm getting hungry!! Didn't get this finished. Mail man here.\n",

      "There! Guess that catches everybody but the Shulers and they are too far off to catch. Sure enjoyed the picnic at the Peace Gardens! Did it rain? It started to rain here about 1 p.m. and the sun had been shining till Mom mentioned \"picnic\" and we got the results wayyyy down here. Whenever we're up that-a-way and somebody says \"picnic\" it always rains, so we got it long distance this time. Too bad we had such a poor connection and then I'd have gabbed longer. Last time I called Mom and Margie when Mutt was in California I ran up a bill of $13.00 and this bill was only $2.40. If I'd known that was all it was, I'da talked another $2.50 worth!! Finally got the packages off today. Sent a package to Omaha for Colleen with some of Karen's outgrown clothes. Sent Karen's green coat and bonnet with the red hearts on the sleeves and got it all cleaned and pressed and then had to squeeze it up in a little ball to get it in the box, so don't know why I got it looking purdy before I sent it. Oh well, it's clean, anyway. I always do things up right on time. Only 4 months late with Mom's and Maggie's birthday present and had Mom's made in February!! Just read in the paper that the husband of the lady that made Mom's gift passed away. He was a nice man, but was full of cancer, and in terrific pain, so it's probably a blessing. Master Sergeant Roose, down the street here, said he talked to my brother in Omaha at the N.C.O. club. He's the fellow whose wife won that dinette set, and stuff I was telling you about, Frank. Just love to hear his wife and daughter talk. It's \"blimey\" this, and so and so's a \"bloak\" (whatever that is) and boy, pure ol' England talk. Boy, I'll bet Grandma and Grandpa are having fun with all their babies home. I'm dying to see the Monger and Fay offspring, but 'twill be October before we get up that way. About October 6th, if I can get off. Does Colleen look like Becky? My gosh, she's almost 5 months old, isn't she? Does she still have red hair?? Questions, questions, questions, but it just sounded so good just to hear all the voices that I was about ready to flap my wings and head north for the summer. Didn't get to say \"Hi\" to Lil, though, and it was so darned hard to hear, I even forgot to put Mutt on the line and he was sitting right there on the davenport. (Confounded people keep coming in here for first aid! Don't they know I'm writing a letter!!!) We went to a drive-in Saturday nite and saw Red Skeleton in \"Watch My dust.\" He invents a gas-mobile, in the show, and it gets away from him and almost runs over him. Karen giggled till I thought she'd never quit. The twins don't get much kick out of it yet, but she really enjoys them. Mark just goes along for the ride. Mom, you were worrying about it being too hot down here, and I'll bet we've had a cooler summer than you have up there. 'Course we never know when it's really going to break loose and cook us. Can understand why you don't feel like making two trips, though. Wonder if the Shulers are going to have a daughter this time. 'Twould be nice. Good Evening!! It's 6 p.m. July 8th and will try again. Think the good Lord is all mixed up, because it was so cold here this forenoon I had to put long overalls on the kids and sweaters! Could be Alaska instead of New Mexico. It warmed up enough this afternoon to take their sweaters off, but they still wore jeans instead of sunsuits. Isn't that crazy, for July in New Mexico?? Sure had a lazy day today. Didn't get up till 8:45 and then had the kids all in bed with me for awhile, till Mark started hollering, \"Wanna eat, Mommie!\" so we got up and had breakfast. Baked a chocolate pie for dinner and we had steak and french fries, too. Yum, yum! They're digging up the water pipes again in the back yard which means up comes our fence around our garden and our potatoes and tomatoes. Think I'll wrap a fence post around their necks if I catch 'em in the act of digging up our garden, but no doubt it will have to come up. They had all that dug up in March and April and are right at it again. Mutt came hone at 11 today and said, \"My gosh, did your clock stop? Where's dinner?? etc etc etc.\" I got all rattled for a minute and thought for a second the clock had stopped and finally said, \"You lil devil you, that clock is right, isn't it?\" He almost had me convinced till I looked at my watch, and started breathing again when I discovered he was home early, and that I hadn't missed his dinner. Then he didn't have to go to work till 2 p.m. because the Captain had a meeting with the Colonel and he didn't have anything to do. It will be another week before they get their training program set up, so right now they have it kind of easy. Here comes a \"victim\" for me to work on, so will quit again. How's about a letter, please, please, please?? With all the local dirt and family gossip. Haven't gotten the Tribune since December but am going to reorder it this weekend. Did Dr. Fox's have a baby? Last Tribune we had said they had a \"pink and blue\" shower for Mrs. Fox. Will, Toddle-oo, you-all, and we hope to see you in October? PS Mutt's name has been sent up for Warrant Officer, but he won't be eligible for it till November, so we'd have to sit tight, wait till then. That will make it real easy for you to remember, Helen, because then he'd just be called plain \"Mr.\" Jones. Don't know if that'd mean a transfer or not. Give all those kids a big love for us. Start with John (Careful, now, don't knock his glasses off), then Sandra, (woops, don't pull her braids) then Jim (watch him!! He might like smoochin so much, he won't quit!) then Becky, and Donita, and Mona and Maria, and Colleen and don't forget little Margie and Sadie. (Alright Donnie and Lester, quit fighting over Margie!! Grandma is spose to deliver all these kisses!! Know you wouldn't dare start on Sadie, because by now she's probably learned how to cut people's gizzards out, so watch out!) G'd nite and somebody please give Grandpa and Grandma lots o' lovin' for us.\n",

      "Thank you for your letter, mom. 'Twere the longest juiciest letter I have had from you in a long time and sure enjoyed it. Fully understand why you could not come and see us but maybe next time we will think of it at a more opportune time. Do not wait for a special invitation, though. If you decide to come and see us anytime, then just come anytime and bring Pappy Fay with you if he can get away. You are welcome any time, you know. Suppose Frank and Lil have gone back now. Sure would like to see them. Maybe we can, in October. Have thought about coming home for Christmas instead of October, but it is so darned cold then and probably would have to take the car part way and then take the train the rest of the way, so it will probably be October. It would be nice to be home for Christmas again, but do not believe it would work out very well. We are going to think it over anyway. Have your letter here with me and see that Earl is going to be home this Friday. But Sadie's up in 7th, heaven someplace (wherever that is - nobody seems to know, yet lots of people go there, I am told) Anyway, I hope there are not any last minute change of plans for him. The army is good at that. They called a bunch of fellow back from Furlough, here, for maneuvers this week. The fellow across the street got in last night but his wife and daughter stayed in Portland, to finish up the Furlough. Just never, never know!! She got a baby sitter for a couple hours Saturday and went shopping. I had to get duty show and nylons again and the bays all needed summer sleepers, and Karen got a new pink blouse, so they are all happy now. Saturday nite Mutt went to the ball game. the duke's last game in town till august. She went to the game on July 12th because one of the Duke's pitcher's was getting married at home plate. Believe I told you about that, though, did not I? Sunday we took the kids to the city zoo and Karen's eyes almost popped out, especially at the camels, lions, and bears. They all got a big kick out of the monkeys, too. There is a pretty nice zoo here and it is the first time we have ever been out there. Sadie and Margie should shoot us for not taking them there, so they could see the monkeys and the \"bars\" and the lions and stuff. She have seen so much more of the city now that we both have weekends off and we try to plan something or someplace we can all go on the days off. I tell ye we have more darned fun!! Mark came home this morning with his hair painted yellow. Boy, it was \"piddy\" too, he thought. Got most of it out. His hair is still a little stiff in spots, but it will come out in the wash some day. Well, that is all for tonight. Business got rushing and now it is 11:45 so must type up my log for tonight, fill supplies, etc. Will scratch off some more lines tomorrow night. Tuesday evening July 22 Will try again! Got a letter from Sadie today saying Earl was not coming home yet. She sounded pretty disappointed and I know he must be, too. Maybe he will make the next shipment home. Business has been busy tonight. Have had 14 patients in and it is only 10:30. They have been working overtime till 3 a.m. every other week in another building here, so Lala and I have alternated working the overtime. She works Monday and Wednesday and I work Tuesday and Thursday till 3 on the overtime week. This is a 1 a.m. week and next week will each have to put in a couple hours overtime two nites each again. Mutt has to go help paint their classroom after he takes me home at 1 a.m. and then he gets tomorrow off to sleep. He had part of the afternoon off, too, today. They should be ready to start classes next Monday or so. They he will not have so many spare minutes as he does night now. He surprises us every once in awhile and pops in to see us. One nice thing about living on the base. I has so relieved to hear you had dropped a couple extra curricular activities, mom. But you will get a little rest now. am real curious to hear who they will put on the school board now. Does not seem possible that the last of the tribe is out of high school, and ready for college. July 24, 1952, 11:30 P.M. Gonna finish this off and mail it tomorrow. She will probably have a change of address for you next week sometime. Housing officer called us today at noon and said there is a 3-bedroom house on Project Drive, main drop of the housing, case you have forgotten, Sal and Mergo, being vacated and we can have it, so we are going to look at it tomorrow and will likely take it. Karen has had her eyes lit up ever since we told her, because now she will have a room of her own, and maybe the bays will not tear up everything for her. It is just around the corner from where we are and has not grass or flowers and ours are all beginning to bloom now, but expect to be here for a couple years (we keep telling ourselves) so better take it when we can get it. They are going to paint it all for us before we move in, so it will be nice and clean. It will not be much trouble to move as there will not be any packing this time. The neighbors across the alley from us (with 4 bays) are moving into a 3-bedroom next to me, so we will know them, anyway. Their bays and our bays fight gallantly, so a gay time should be had by all. They have been here for 5 1/2 years in the same house! Imagine that! Sounds like a lifetime to me. There, we will send you a line and let you know if we move or not. Keep sending your mail here, though, till you get the new house number, because we will get it, anyway. PS Moving to New Mexico. Our new address is M/Sgt. FE-Jones 1811 Project Drive Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. Looked at the house this morning and it is very nice and clean. Floors all freshly varnished and just bigger all round.\n",

      "Have the kids all sleeping, so will write a few lines while it's nice and peaceful. Have the dinner dishes to wash, but will do them after the kids wake up from their naps. You should see what Mutt got for my birthday. A new Wurlitzer piano!!! We'll ahve it worn out by the time my birthday gets here, because it's been going almost steady since they delivered it Saturday P.M. Sure do enjoy it, though. Don't know if the neighbors enjoy it so much or not, but it's worth its weight in gold to me. We've wanted to rent one, but it costs $10 a month to rent one, so decided to add $10 and pay $20 a month and own it, eventually. Don't know when we've had so much enjoyment out of a purchase. Every few minutes one of the kids comes in and says, \"Can I pay yo' Peeanno?\" Soooo they play a few minutes and out they go and another one comes in to \"Pay the Peeanno\". mark sings like mad when he's playing. The rest of them know \"Jesus Loves Me,\", so he sits there and sings \"Dee do lu me.\" He can't go any further than that, and sometimes it's just \"Deedo,\" \"Deedo, \"Deedo.\" Saturday nite \"Bunny and Bo\" were here for birthday cake with Mark. I didn't have time to bake one Thursday and he didn't know when his birthday was supposed to be, anyway, so it worked out fine. We had fried chicken and believe Bernie and Flo had as much fun as Mark did. They brought him a white milk truck /c three little milk bottles, so the kids have been delivering milk all day. They absolutely idolize that boy of ours. There was a carnival in one of the hangars here last week and Bernie wanted to stop and get Mark and Flo said he just couldn't, cuz it'd make the other 3 feel bad, so they went without him. Sure too bad they couldn't have a child of their own. He'd be spoiled rotten, probably, but there's a lot of love going to waste there that some little fellow somewhere could sure use. Got real ambitious this morning and got the whole house cleaned up before 11. Washed clothes Friday, so will have to start on the ironing tomorrow. Never seem to completely catch up on that. Karen had another headache last night. She gets them every one in a while and as soon as she vomits a time or two her headache is gone like magic. If I recall correctly, didn't I used to have headaches like that when I was little? Sounds like Migraine headaches, but they usually don't strike till they're a little older than Karen is. There sure has been a turn-over of personnel here in the last two weeks. There have been about 10 houses on this street alone that have changed occupants since we moved in here. (No, our moving in didn't scare them away, Daddy! There! I said it before you did!) Gosh darn it, time's gone by too fast. Gotta quit and wash dishes. Finish this later. Love, Betty. Tuesday, will add a few more lines while I dare my male babies to flutter an eyelash!! Put them to bed and went in the kitchen to put the food away and when I came back Rodney was reading a book, Mark was admiring his toenails and Richard was worrying over a scratch on his knee that was \"blooding,\" Karen had her pajama bottoms tied around her waist in a knot and couldn't get them untied. Pa just went back to work. He's got a cold so isn't feeling up to par these last couple days. 6 P.M. Decided to take this to work with me to get it finished. Fell asleep at noon and woke up with the pencil and stationery on the floor. Put in for my vacation today from October 6 through 17th, so should know in a few days whether I can get off or not. The kids are sure looking forward to going to see Bampa and Bamama. Hope it's not too cold up there, because I'd hate to have to buy long underwear and fur coats for us when we get there. Karen wrote a letter to you today and I asked her to read it to me and it was something like this: \"Dear Grampal and Grandmal (don't know why she puts the \"l\" on the end of your name, but she does). How are Jimmie, Sandra, and John? We're coming to see you after my birthday. This is a house for big angels and that is a house for little angels. I love you very much. Love, your girl Karen.\" When she read it to her Daddy a couple hours later it went like this: \"Dear Grandpal and Grandmal, How are Pat's and Donnie's three little girls. That's a house for the big angels and that's a house for the little angels and I love you very much. Love, Karen.\" I promised her I'd mail it, so will send it along. Well, will see thee in about 7 weeks.\n",

      "Got your letter today, Mom, and just called the depot to see what it would cost us to come by coach. Darned near died when I found out it is $84.72 each for P and I and $42.36 for Karen, total $211.80, one way!! So by the time we figured meals, etc., it'd be $500 to get up there and back. Got to figuring, too, we couldn't take the kids without buying almost a complete set of warmer clothes for each one of them and by that time we'd be wayyy in the hole again and no Christmas presents for the kids. Wouldn't want to start out with them by car at that time of year after getting stranded in snow in June, we wouldn't be brave enough to dare mid-winter in a car. Called the airport and it'd cost Mutt and I $218.96 each, round trip and half fare for each of the kids so it'd total up to $875.84 by air. Soooooooo you'll have to count us out for Christmas. Mutt says we could wait and come in the spring if you decided to have a reunion then, but Karen wouldn't wait till spring, I'll betcha!! She has talked Grandma and Grandpa every day for months and believe she'd start down the road if we don't get up there pretty soon. She tells everyone that as soon as she has a birthday she can go see her Grandma and Grandpa. I was under the impression that Fritz's baby was due the 1st of September, so I miscalculated a little with my vacation, however I've already sent in a vacation request and it's at A. E. O. now awaiting approval, so it looks like it will have to be October 6th or wait till spring. I'm not even positive it will come through for now, but I'll let you know. Sure doesn't leave you any time with Fritzie, though. She better take a dose of castor oil about the 7th or 8th. Believe if I hadn't taken a dose before Mark was born, I'd still be carrying him. Oh, did you know I took a good swig of Castor Oil and a hot enema the evening of the night I went to the hospital?? Well, I did!! It worked, too. Well, it's 10 P.M. now. Got interrupted somewhere along the line and hours have passed. Had a letter from Sibitoday. Sonny (the older boy) was jsut getting over an attack of rhumatic fever.. Lorelei had a 8 pound 13 ounce boy July 29th and the baby is fine, but something went wrong someplace and Lorelei has terrible occipital (back of head) headaches and Blood pressure of 200 since delivery. Mrs. Gene is with Lorelei, but Sib didn't say where that was. Doctors don't know what the trouble is. Called home earlier tonight and Mark got to the telephone first and said, \"Hullo,\" I said, \"Is that you, Mark.\" He says, \"nuh huh!\" I said, \"How'd you get that telephone.\" and he said, \"Take it!\", about that time Daddy came along and took over, and Mark went outside to play. Mark things he's quite the man!! After all he's \"Two ee oh\" now! August 27th, 9 am. Have the kids fed, dressed, patted and combed and outside playing. Air Installations is painting garbage cans today, so will have a battle keeping the kids away till the paint dries. Ah, now I have a better pen. It's easier to handle than those darned ball point pens. Put in for my vacation October 13th through weekend of 24th, so will see you folks then. i wrote to Fritz and Bruce last night so they know we can't get home Christmas. Suggested they come in October, too, as their baby should be a month old by then. That's what the twins were when we went from California to North Dakota, to Florida. We're going through Omaha on this trip and wrote to Frank and Lil to tell them if they want to pile and go with us they could and if they didn't want to go on up there then, we were still going to come by and see them, anyway. We had a sad sad accident here yesterday. Mutt had taken me to work and on his way back just happened to glance back in the back seat and there sat Karen with her eyes full of tears and choking back the sobs. Mutt asked her what was the matter and boy! The whole Mississippi River broke loose and she finally blurted out, \"Grandma's letter blowed out the window!\" Mutt said she cried like her heart would break, so he turned around and went back and found it for her. She had carried it with her all afternoon and wouldn't let go of it even to go the bathroom, the letter had to to go, too, and when it \"blowed out the window,\" it took her heart with it. She is the most sentimental thing you ever saw. Tell her a sad story, or when Mutt was singing a ballad one day about a little girl on the train going to visit her daddy in prison and we happened to look at her and the tears were rolling down her cheeks and we asked her what the trouble was and she just hid her face and tried to hide her eyes so we wouldn't see her cry. Then she came out in the kitchen and said, \"Mommie, I don't like that 'cry' song that Daddy sings!\" I'd better get this in an envelope and stamped before the mailman gets here. We'll see you about the 13th. Plan to leave here early Saturday a.m. (11th) so should be there either late the 13th or sometime the 14th. Have a nice trip, Mom, and we're awfully sorry we can't make it at Christmas, but there's too much money involved.\n",

      "Happy Birthday!! Yah! I know, I'm late! your birthday card is still waiting for you, at our house, on the buffet. Someday I'm going to send it to you! Pa Jones went looking for another pipe lighter for you (I hear yours is broken) and the PX doesn't have any right now. Have never seen them anyplace else, so if we find one of those it will be coming your way, if not I'll put a stamp on the end of Mark's nose and send him to you for your birthday. He was getting smart with me the other day, so I turned around and picked up my switch I keep, to scare him with and he grabbed the seat of his pants and went out of there yelling, \"I tell Bampa, I tell Bampa!!\" so, of course, I wouldn't dare spank him. What he didn't know was that I had no intentions of spanking him that time, anyway. Don't know what the trip up there did to Richard, but whatever it was it was a miracle. He had been so cross and irritable and whiny for several months before we went up there, that I was really beginning to wonder what the dickens was wrong with his personality. Since we came back here, he's a changed boy. His disposition is 100% better, he no longer stands and howls while Mark beats him black and blue but has started to defend himself a little and believe me, he's pure mischief!! His eyes twinkle and he will stand and tease and just dare you to get made and if I do then he giggles like mad and runs for dear life. Guess he's one of those kids that thrive extra good with grandparents. He even plays better with the other little boys in the neighborhood. I'm sure I don't know what did it, but he's a much sweeter little rascal than he was!! Think we'll keep him!! By the way, before I forget it!! I put on a jacket, that I hadn't worn since I was up there and reached in the pocket and pulled out a pair of white, ladies panties size 42!! How they got there, I'll never know!!! But anyway, \"Mom, are you missing a pair of pants????\" I accused Mutt of having a new girlfriend \"size 42\" and he darned near died. Was sure glad and put the jacket on in the house instead of outside because there were fellows from Air Installation out there watering the new grass they seeded when we were gone. I'm purely stumped though as to who in the dickens put those in my jacket pocket!!! It game me quite a chuckle, anyway, when I pulled them out of my pocket. 'Specially when I looked at the size and realized they weren't mine. They don't look big enough for 24's, but that's what the tag says. Maybe Pat stuck 'em in my pocket the day we washed clothes at her house? I dunno, anyway, if anybody has lost 'em, I have 'em!! Called Johnnie Du Puis today and made an appointment with him to see what he can do with Karen's hair, and he said Gail was in false labor last week, but so far, nothing, so tell Papa Du Puis his latest grandchild isn't here yet. First time that we've ever been home that we haven't seen him I believe. Johnnie's little boy, Gary, is a real cute little fellow, about 15 months old, I think. We're going to drive out there next Sunday and bring them a bunch of the boys outgrown clothes and some baby stuff of the kids and a folding gate to put in her kitchen door. They're having it a little rough, as he's paid by the number of customers he gets and it takes a while to build up a following. He says they're starting to come back to him now, and send in their friends so he hopes they'll be on their feet pretty soon. See by the Tribune where you've been running around the country with somebody else's wife, Daddy!! Some woman by the name of Mrs. Donald Morgan!! Tsk, tsk. What do you think about such goings on, Mom?? Guess it's only fair, though, after all, because last summer the paper said that Mrs. Fay went clear to Oregon with Mr. Donald Morgan!! I'm a tellin' you that Tribune misses nothing, except the news that everybody says, \"no use writing you about this and that day it will be in the Tribune.\" Then the paper misses that and I just darned near die of curiosity. Got the Tribune yesterday, so now have to wait a week to find out the election returns up there. Politics has sure been flying thick here. Everyone is wondering here if it will make any difference in all the unnecessary overtime that a lot of them put in as they get time and a half for all overtime and just automatically put in 3 Saturdays a month just to get the big fat pay checks. Whether there's anything to do or not doesn't matter. To-morrow noon I'm going to a luncheon at the Coronado Club here on the base for one of the girls that are leaving and one that is getting married. It's only one hour, as the girls just have from 12 to 1 off for lunch, and have to punch the old time clock at 1 o'clock. I've never been to any of the other luncheons they've had for any of the others, but one of the nurses even offered to come and get me, soooo I got a baby sitter and am leaving, goodbye for one whole hour. Monday night I took a can of chili along to work with me for my supper and ate it around 9 o'clock. Got sick as a dog on it and wrapped up everything a couple hours later. Couldn't keep anything down all the next day and didn't work that night. Soon as I recovered, Mutt started feeling bad and he got up first thing this morning and wiped like mad and feels pretty touch today. I'm trying to tell him that he's P.6., but he doesn't seem to think so! I don't know how, with him having morning sickness, it looks suspicious!! Well, as long as it's his turn to have the next \"dede.\" I believe it will take quite a while and he has to take his turn at production now!! Well, daddy, this letter is getting too long. Hope you had a happy birthday, and have many, many more.  P.S. Are you and Mom coming to spend Christmas with us this year? IT won't be near as cold here as it is up there in N. Oak. next to the North Pole! We got a bed for you and lots of sheets and pillow-cases and a blanket for you, and I'll fix you some oyster stew, and Mom won't have to bathe any babies or wash away diapers this time when you come to see us. Think it over!! And then come a runnin'. We'll be here. P. S. Tell Pat snowsuits just got here from cleaners. Will mail them to Connie this Sat A.M. She should get them middle of next week. Hope those little blonde dolls of theirs aren't freezing to death. My! My! Look what I found!!! The letter I wrote you right after we got here to tell you we made it O.K. Well, now you know.\n",

      "Does this mean you can come and spend Christmas with us??????? (Newspaper clipping says, \"NOTICE. I will ship stock on December 12 and do not expect to ship again until January 9. John Fay.\") Boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!!!!! We've got our fingers crossed that that's what it means. Gee would that be wonderful!! We'd hang up extra socks for you!! Ahh, come on now!!!! It's real nice country down here!! Nice people, too. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. We'd even roast a turkey if you'd come help us eat it!! You haven't ever been with us at Christmas!!! We'd treat you nice and give you a good bed to sleep in!! You wouldn't even have to wash the dishes!! Or scrub the floors!!! Ahh come on now! It's not too awfully far!! Trains and plains arrive and depart here every day!!! Our kids ain't never had grandparents at our house for Christmas! Oh, heavens, before I forget it, have you heard anything about Aunt Martha? Kenny was here a couple hours Saturday waiting to catch a hop to Los Angeles. Uncle Gus operated on Aunt Martha for a perforated stomach ulcer, almost always an emergency operation, and just as he made the incision, her heard stopped beating. The doctor that was assisting him, quick-like made an incision over her heart and massaged her heart till it started beating right again. Kenny didn't know just how she was. Said his dad wrote that much to him, so he decided to go out there and see how she was. Oh, yes, he's broken his engagement with his girl and has a new girl in Roswell now. Thinks it's time he settled down and gets married now, he says. He's a good kid! Had a letter from Lil and she said her folks were coming down there for Christmas. You going to ride that far with them to catch a train into Albuquerqueerque??? She said Colleen is walking and is beating the heck out of Becky and Becky is too dumbfounded to figure out what's going on. Had a letter from Fritzie. They're still going to try for their girl but hopes they wait a little bit longer this time.Drove out to Johnnie DuPris' Sunday but they weren't home, so didn't get to see their new daughter, Cathy Ann. Not much news from this direction. Kids growing like weeds. Richard has crawled back in his shell again. Think I'll have to send him up to you, Grandma. December 11, 12:30 AM. Will add a few more lines and then get this mailed tomorrow. Have been busy the past few nights so better get this off, so you can let us know when you are coming to see us! Give our love to little Sadie and little Margie. Will write again sometime, when I get the time and can get in the mood. PS Let us know if you're coming for Christmas, and if you do, I'll bet you we could get Dad Jones and Marie to drive out here, too. Good night.\n",

      "I owe everybody under the sun letters and I can't seem to get at them. We've really had the sand storms here lately. One day last week, we had to drive with our lights on, at about 10 miles an hour coming east to take me to work, at 4:30 p.m. The A.P.'s at the Kirtland gate had gas masks on, s you can imagine what the sand was like. The next day it was absolutely beautiful. Sun shining like mad, didn't even need sweaters! Saturday I washed clothes and Sunday a.m. got them dampered and folded, and today I ironed and got it all done. February 17th 8 p.m. Got busy last night so didn't get this finished. Sure had a lazy day at home today. Went visiting down the street this morning and came home in time to fix steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, buttered yellow wax beans, and hot biscuits for dinner, took a nap when the kids slept this p.m., cleaned up the kitchen after our naps, so all in all it was a nice relaxing day. Just talked to Mutt and the kids and he said the boys got a little box of matches, took them in their room and lit them all. Luckily, nothing caught on fire, but he told them that if they didn't care whether they had a house to live in, they might as well move outside, so he took them out in the front porch and shut the door on them. He said you'd have thought he's killed them, the way they cried. When I talked to them on the telephone they told me about it and they were pretty meek and mild. Richard said it would be \"ufful\" if the house burned down and they all said they weren't \"ever gonna do it no more\". Yesterday, when I was bushing like mad, so I'd get the ironing finished before time to go to work, Rodney got up from his nap and came in and held out his hand (with all the buttons that belonged on his shirt!!) and said, \"Lookit, mommie, alllllllll the buttons comed off my shirt!\" I said, \"How'd they come off?.\" He replied, \"ohhheh, they dist comed off!.\" I said, \"Rodney, you pulled all those buttons off, didn't you?.\" Real coy-like he said, \"Shuh, me did!.\" I took the buttons and said, \"Alright, which hand pulled the buttons off!.\" He said, \"Both of 'em!\" So I spanked both hands and told him next time those naughty hands pulled his buttons off I'd have to spank them again. I sent him in to bed while I sewed the buttons back on and I heard him telling Richard, \"Wichad, don't evah, evah let yo' naughty hands pull the buttons off yo' shirt no moah, cuz then the naughty hands get spanked!!\" and Richard said, \"O.K., I won't !.\" So that was the end of that! Little rascals. They sure are funny sometimes. They've been real busy with valentines and got some from the Dreges at noon and the Mongers this p.m., and Shulers and Sharon Jones yesterday, so they're all set now. Mutt is busy instructing in the new radar school that he and Captain Matlock set set up here. This week he has 2 Colonels, one Lt. Colonel and a Major in is class. He was cutting up before he left for work this morning and said, \"Alright, boys, just leave your \"eagles\" and \"Maple Leaves\" up on my desk here, because while you're in this class, you're the Pfc's and I'm the boss!\" Then, of course, he laughed!! Can just feature him daring to pull such chatter with them! He is the boss when he's instructing in a school like that, but \"military courtesy\" still rules. He's a pretty good egg, that man o' mine!! Hear from Helen that Pat's kids are sick again. They're really having a time with those kids, aren't they. Ours had the flu, but that's all over and everybody is in the pink of condition. Getting awfully anxious to get out and dig in the dirt and plant some flowers, but guess that will have to wait another month yet. By the way, how come Daddy doesn't have any \"Livestock Shipping\" ad in the paper? Hasn't been in the last two issues. At least, I couldn't find it. He hasn't closed up shop yet, has he? Just found out we get Monday off as a holiday (Washington's birthday falls on Sunday). Pretty nice. Next payday we have our little brood up for shoes again. Karen has to have summer clothes this year, too. She's about at the end of her rope, but don't want to get too many now, because she's going to need lots o' stuff for school this fall. Had a note from Fritz and she is learning to drive. Said Timmy got bounced to the floor in the back seat twice and he wasn't very happy about it. She said Big Bird had stopped by and was going to Pullman to write his thesis for his \"Major.\" Said she thought she caught a hint of a \"girlfriend\", but wasn't too sure. Kids sure enjoyed their \"get well\" cards you sent. By the way, we'll send you your picture (of the right proof) that was taken of the kids at Christmas time. This one is better of Karen, so hide the other one. Rodney is on the left. Ever hear any more about Aunt Martha? How did Delmar Grove's mother get along? Well, I've gotta clean up the station and it's just about time to go home. Tell Helen I'm really gonna answer her letters one of these days! I haven't forgotten her. Richard said today that he knew where Sandra, Jim, and John lived. \"First we go to 'Dramma's' (Grandma's), then we go to Lessa's (Lesters), and there they are!\" \n",

      "I owe Helen and Pat and Fritzie and Frank and Margie letters and found Sadie's (that I'd have sworn I mailed a week ago) in my dressing table drawer today, so imagine it' been some time since you heard from out this way. I can't write letters if I'm not in the mood, and haven't been in the mood for ages it seems. Nothing wrong, just couldn't seem to get a pen and get started. Well, the medical department opened a new medical building this week. Haven't been over to see it yet, but they say it's a beauty. Rumors have it that Phil (the other night nurse) and I will both be as we are now. This is a waste of manpower the way I sit here at government (taxpayer) expense every night with little or nothing to do. Keep up with all the lates women's magazines, anyway, so the time doesn't seem to drag, but such expensive \"dragging\". Now, will break the news gently. We bought a 1953 two-tone green Monterey Mercury last Monday. They offered us $2000 and the highest offer we'd had on the other one from anyone else was $1775, so we took it. It's really pretty. Top is very light green (almost white) and the body a medium green. The visibility is what I noticed most. Of course I'm not very well-versed in cars, anyway, but we sure like \"Mercuries\". The dash is all condensed just back of the steering wheel (drawing) and it has a suspended brake pedal instead of the former floor pedal. \"Yours truly\" is going to learn to steer the darned thing, or bust!! That's all there is to do is steer, but I'll probably bust before I learn to do that. Have good intentions, anyway. Mutt had to go to the east radar site on an inspection trip on Wednesday so drove it down there and hit snow and slush all the way, so the \"water-squirting\" windshield wipers have been initiated and found to be really useful. It has \"back-up\" lights, too, so you can see, when you're backing up, just where to go. Am almost convinced that I could drive it. Used to drive your Chevy, Daddy, back in 1943 or 1944 and that never bothered me a bit, but now with 4 little monkeyshines in the back seat I get jittery. Maybe I'm just getting old. I'm so pleased over Karen's hair. I gave her a Prom permanent a year ago and last month and the permanent smell has been in her scalp all that time. Then finally had Johnny DuPris cut it (he did a very good job!) and now it's beginning to curl like it did when she was little (before I gave her the \"Prom\").  Her disposition is even 100% better when she's dressed nice and has her hair curled. They say, \"Clothes don't make the man\", but personal appearance makes a world of difference in a person's self-confidence, I swear!! She got a nice compliment from her ballet teacher last Saturday. Mutt went to pick her up after her lesson at 10 AM and Mrs Johnson told him that Karen had natural talent and a after they had a program in May, she'd like to put Karen in the advanced class. She sure has gotten limber since she started those lessons. She's had them 3 months now and they've been worth every nickel of it. She's crazy about it, too, and though I'm sure she will never be a professional or anything anywhere's near that, it is still a good outlet for her energy. They're also learning the \"hula-hula\" now. Mark can dance \"put yo wide toot wight dah!\" With her, and the twins are like a couple little cows trying to dance, but they think they're pretty good, so I don't say anything. Mark fell in the toilet again the other day!! He had a long sleeved t-shirt on and got both arms soaked to the elbows. He came running out, crying like mad, and said, \"Ain't donna nevah do potty, no mo!!\" I told him I'd change his t-shirt and then he could go potty again, and guess he changed his mind because I'm still wiping \"sprinkle\" marks off the wall back of the toilet. He sure is a poor shot!!! Mutt went to the north site today on an inspection tour and didn't get back till 7 PM, but he had arranged for Sergeant Prottengeier and Gloria and sons to spend the afternoon and evening and babysit so we gabbed all afternoon (they came out about 11, so were here for dinner) and then \"Punk\" (that's Sergeant Prottengeier) and the kids took me to work. We always pay them for \"sitting\", but they don't have a TV and they just love to come out. (They're the kids from Minneapolis). Punk thought he'd just won a million dollars when Mutt told him the car would be at the house so he came up there and got the car and went home and got Gloria and the kids, drove the car to work (3 blocks!), and then took me to work and he was up in seventh heaven to think Mutt would let him drive a car that new!! They're real nice kids, about Frank's age, I think. She reminds me a lot of Fritzie Fay Shuler. Anybody hear anything about how Frank and Lil are making out. I don't know, I may be way off, but I can't help but feel someday Frankie will really wake up and appreciate his little family. They seemed so happy when we were there in October and Lil said then that they'd been getting along real well and really looked sincere about it. Was so surprised to hear they were having trouble. Wonder what went wrong? Later. Well, it's 10 AM, so time to close shop. Mutt called at 11:40 PM and he was just getting to bed. He was up at 5:30 this morning as they left at 6:30, and has inspection in the morning at 8:30 so will have to get his uniform pressed in the morning. Want to wash clothes, too, and had some shopping we wanted to do in the PM, so don't know if we'll get it all done or not. Sure is a busy old world! Oh, yes, and Karen has ballet at 9:00. Guess that's all except that the boys all have to have haircuts again. Lined them all up for shoes last weekend, so that's done for another little while. Gotta quit! Kids version of Grandma and Grandpa, to Richard it's \"Dramma\" and \"Drampa\", to Rodney it's \"Vamma\" and \"Bampa\", to Mark you're both \"Bamma\", to Karen it was \"Mammo\" and \"Bampa\".\n",

      "This place is like the city morgue, dead quiet. Phil will be back from her vacation Monday and that will liven up the place a bit again. It's been a funny night. The wind started up about 3:30 PM and by 4:30 the sand was really blowing. Then the wind died down, it rained a little while and now it's colder than blazes outside. Wonder if that atomic blasting in Nevada isn't causing some of this freak weather? Don't see how it could help but alter it one way or another from all the force it has. We tried to call you Mother's Day, but by 9 PM there was still a 3 to 6 hour delay, so cancelled it. Guess everybody had the same idea we did. The kids brought me home a pretty peach-colored Kleenex flower for Mother's Day (from Sunday school) and then Karen and I went to the service club at 3 PM, because they were to get their pictures taken in their ballet costumes. They took the 3 year olds first and while they were snapping pictures of them, I looked at Karen and she had the longest face!! Asked her what the trouble was and she just said, \"Nothing\". Then I looked around and saw that almost all the other 4 and 5 year olds and older, had lipstick on and she didn't, so I took her in the dressing room and put some lipstick on her and she was up in seventh heaven someplace. They have dress rehearsal Saturday morning and the recital is Sunday afternoon. I got two new dresses for Mother's Day, too. They're cotton dresses and one is trimmed with eyelet and one is of glazed cotton, so I'll be a real purdy mamma now! Friday we take Karen down for her preschool physical. Seems kinda funny to have a daughter ready for school. Makes me feel old!! Then I comb my hair and see all the white ones coming in and I really feel old then! Oh, before I forget it, Daddy I have a couple bonds (or, one, I'm not sure which) that mature in June this year, and wondered if you'd send them to me so I can ash them and get one big bond with them. We got a safety deposit box to keep them in now, and there's something about it that they'll not draw as much interest after maturity unless you renew them, or some such thing, so thought I'd get them together and find out what the score is on them. I signed up to have $75 a month taken out of my check for bonds, and have gotten one so far. Should have done that months ago, instead of the little bond ($18.75), because as long as it's in our pockets, there's always something to spend it on, and we never know where it goes. We got along just as well last month as we did before with the extra money, too! Can't figure it out. Had the nicest letter from Frank when Lil and their house apes (as he called them) were in North Dakota. First letter I'd had from him since he was in Japan, so answered it right away. (Had a cute little story in it, too, Daddy. Will send it along! Don't let Mamma read it, because she will think I'm not nice, and I am, I chuckled and chuckled when I read that little story!) Mom!! You give that story back to Daddy!!! Aren't you ashamed of yourself to read stuff like that?? Shame on you!!!!! See, I knew you'd read it!! Now, don't you think that's a cute little story??? It must be a nice story because Frank wouldn't send any of his sisters a story that wasn't real nice, would he? Just noticed the clock says 11 PM, so I'd better go scour the whirlpool, dust off the desks, and wash my coffee cup and the coffee pot. Then my day will be done, and I can go home with Pa. Mark always has to go potty when we get home and Karen has to have a drink and once in a while the twins get up, too, for a drink of water at 2 AM. Little night owls, that's what we have. Well, g'night and be good kids. I embroidered a pair of pillowcases for you, Mom, and they were so dirty I had to wash them before I dared to send them. I got them ironed today, so one of these days I'll get them mailed to you. Hope you had a real nice \"muddow's\" day, as Mark and the twins call it. PS Mutt says I can't send that story. Says it isn't nice!! Seeing as he's the boss in the family I'll leave it out. \n",

      "Have been thinking about you for weeks so will scratch off a few lines. Still have not gotten your Mother's day and Father's day package off to you, be any day now, I will put some stamps on it and maybe get it there for next year. She had a big day at our house today, that made Mutt to feel ages old! Karen lost her first tooth!! I tied a string around the tooth for her, but could not pull it to save my soul, so when her Daddy came home, he pulled it for her and she was so proud of herself and just giggled and giggled when she saw what she looked like. Of course, there is to be a dime under her pillow when she wakes up tomorrow. (Must remember to remind Margie that her teeth are worth at least 10 cents each, in case she has to have hers pulled this summer!) Half expected to hear Margie had left the country with Aussie when he left, but the Tribune did not say so, so guess she is still with you. Had a letter from Sadie and have already answered that. Daddy, I have got a boy here that I am going to send to you!! He is crazy about Mutts old stinky pipe and every time he gets hold of that darned pipe he stinks to high heaven. He prances around there and says, \"I am Drampa!\" Want him?? If you get a call from the depot some day that there is somebody by the name of Mark N. Jones looking for you, just take your pipe and go down there and he will find your pipe and you! By the way, did you get your lots sold? Saw the ad in last weeks Tribune and noticed it was gone this week. Think they turned out to be kind of a headache, anyway, did not they? Might be a good location for a business lot, though. See by the Tribune that aunt Numidia and Unell Fig and now Uncle Hugh have been to visit you. It has been years since uncle Hugh was there, is not it? How did you celebrate mother's day and father's day this year? We just stayed home and related! I got my Pfaff sewing machine that I told you about and Mutt got a lawn swing for the back yard and a seat to hook onto the bleachers when he goes to the ball games. Had a letter from grandpa Jones last week and he says he is \"not feeling so good any more.\" says he gets awfully tired so easy. Have been busy trying to sew a few things for Karen for school. I sure have a lot to learn about sewing, though. It takes me so long and I do so much ripping and resewing, it seems. Have made her a 2 piece sun dress (wrote and told you about that and found the letter at home the other day, again! I am always writing letters 3 weeks or more later, I find them in a drawer someplace!) also a red cotton skirt trimmed with rick-rack, a terry cloth bathrobe, 2 blazers and am in the process of a dress now. Have the top finished and ready to start on the skirt now. Hope to get it finished by September. Guess we are going to have to take Mark back for more X-ray treatments because he is all broken out again. Think I could figure out what he is allergic to. Looks like we will have to be getting him the X-ray treatments the rest of the summer. Little stinker!! We would pull something the day after they cut out dependent's care at the base. She had a real nice visit with Rounsavalla. They were two weeks late getting here, but their orders came in late. They are going to Maryland now. She is going to have a baby in December and she says, \"at my age, too!\" old creature was 30 in March! They looked good. Kenny has diabetes (think I told you in another letter) and he tests his urine himself and gives his own insulin when he needs it. Pretty good for a nine year old, I think. The kids were all in watching television one night and Kenny called to Rachel and said, \"Has that got sugar in it, mother?\". He had seen something on television and she said he asks her all the time about what has sugar and what does not and will not touch anything that has sugar in it. Scanter is past seven now and just the same Scanter he always was. Had a letter from Irene Donahey today, Dayl Sr. is due back from Korea in two weeks. (Leave it to him, he had an office job back away from the front lines, so never saw any action but still gets Ohio overseas time in.) I have already started making your Christmas gift, mom. Ain't the early bird, though?? Have to have something to diabetican patients, so read and sew, and every now and then write a letter or two. I put Karen's ballet costume on her and put her out in the yard and got some colored pictures of her taken finally. Have meant to get some taken and kept putting it off, so decided today, I had better take them before the tooth departed. They are 35mm. film and I have not tried a colored film in that camera before, but if they are good, will show them to you when you come to see us at Christmas time!! (Just thought I should keep reminding you that we hope to hang your socks at our house for Santa Claus this year.) Well, running out of news and out of space, so might as well sign off. Write, please, and tell us all the local gossip \n",

      "Business is pretty slow in here, so might as well write you a few lines as I don't have anybody to gab with anymore. Got a few minutes to sit and chat??? They put Phil on days and cut down the night crews, so I'm back in the machine shop again. I don't get as much homework (sewing, ironing, and mending) done here as I did in the other building, cuz you can't carry all that stuff inside the tech area. The other first-aid station was outside the area and Pa and the kids could even come and visit us there, but they can't come inside the tech area here. I feel a little more as though I earn part of my paycheck over here, though. Just read the Tribune (that's my Monday bible!) and see that Mom and Ericksons were in Omaha. How are Frank and Lil making out? Don't hear from them very often ('bout as often as I hear from the John Fay house, dig! dig! dig!)! Last letter I had from Frank, they expected to be transferred someplace this fall. Do they know anymore about that? Bet those little girls of theirs have really grown. Karen is all excited over school. We register her on August 27th and school starts August 31st. I finished one dress for her and still have a couple more to make, if I ever get that far! I have good intentions, but don't seem to get much farther than the intention itself. Won't get it started this week, I don't think. I got real brave and started taking driving lessons today. At the end of six days, I'm supposed to be able to drive well enough to get a driver's license. The six lessons cost $25.00, and they have dual-control cars, so if they can teach me to drive then it's well worth the $25.00. I died 15 deaths driving the one hour trip this morning, as they take you right through heavy traffic and I turned more darned corners!! Took them on a gay ride around one corner though. It was a little downhill and instead of the street turning thusly (90 degrees) it turned thusly (45 degrees) and if there'd been another car coming I'd have been right over him b'golly. The instructor laughed and said, \"Don't believe you slowed down quite enough for that corner, did you?\" If he's brave enough he will be back tomorrow morning for another one hour jaunt through the city. He told me I did very well for the first day. Suppose he was trying to give me a big bunch of confidence. I told him \"thank you\" and didn't tell him how my knees were knocking!! My knees felt like they would buckle under me for a couple of hours after I was home!! Noives!! That's what it is!! Maybe by Saturday they'll be calmed down a little. Had a letter from Sadie saying my \"little daughter\" is getting married in September! All I can say is they're darned cute kids and I wish them the very best of everything, and I'm just dying to see what my \"grandchildren\" will look like!!! But they'll be cute little musical marines!! Can just see the little Solemirtos! They'll probably be born with a butcher's apron and a nurse's cap on!! Won't that be cute?? Gee, and Helen only has three more months to go! Did she get her x-ray yet?? Sure hope everything goes well with them. Sadie sent us a bunch of pictures taken at Gracie Wig's. Wouldn't have known Jack W. and Gracie sure has gotten lots heavier! She had a dandy snapshot of Daddy and also one of Mom and Mutt wants to get enlarged and framed and hang it in the living room! It's one of Mom, taken when she was in bed, reading a book, and she made the most beautiful face!! Underneath the picture Sadie had written \"My Beautiful Mother\". Think Mutt plans to have the inscription enlarged, too! It's really a beauty!! Did she send you one of those? I must remember to return these pictures to her in the next letter. Sure enjoyed seeing them, though. Also some real cute ones of the Monger triplets! She had some cute ones of Earl in there and some darned cute ones of my \"baby\" and her future husband, too! Goish, here it seems like a couple of years ago there was a little curly-headed blonde girl running around the yard in a pair of striped coveralls and carrying a Japanese umbrella and here she's big enough to get married!! Gosh, where does the time go?? I got real ambitious this morning, and baked two apple pies (pies happen about twice a year at our house), so we'd have something eat as my driving lessons are from 10:30 to 11:30 and Mutt comes home for dinner at 11:30, so I put potatoes in the oven to bake while I was gone and fried steak when I got home and had vegetables all ready to heat, so it worked out real well, today anyway. Hard telling what tomorrow may bring. Saturday morning the 34th Air Division sponsored a tour through the Division, even through the restricted areas, for the wives of the men of the 34th Air Division. Gloria Prottengeier and I went and the daddies watched the kids. It was really interesting too. Showed us the radar and stuff and let us go out to the hangars and they \"scrambled\" some jets for us, so we saw four jets take off right from the hangars, and got to climb up and take a good look at the new F-86-D, the jet that broke the sound barrier. It has radar in the plane and is really interesting. Sunday night the F-86-D was featured on television as the Air Force's newest and fastest jet. It flies over 700 miles an hour! Me?? I'll take ye good ol' \"terra firma\" any day!! It was really something to see, though, and not only that, they served us cherry pie and coffee, too, and all for free!! 'Magine that! Lasted from 8:20 a.m. till shortly after noon. They had a tour like that last year, too, but something came up and we couldn't go. Well, I see it's now 8 p.m. I've had one patient so far, and I'm running out of gab and paper, too. Write someday or by golly I'll call you \"collect\" and you'll be sorry!! Only kidding!! But worried like to hear from you. It's been almost three months now. \n",

      "Gorsh!! Two letters in 3 days from you!!! I've already read them through twice and no doubt I'll read 'em again before I get this letter sent off to you. Guess I'd better get this Minn. deal straightened out first. Now, here's the tale: Colonel Matheny, who thinks the sun rises and sets in Sgt. Jones, and who firmly believes if anything needs fixing or straightening out, or inspecting or advice or any such thing it's, \"Send Sergeant Jones! He can fix it!!.\" and who was transferred to Fort Snelling some months ago, came to Kirtland on a visit a couple weeks ago. He informed Mutt's Commanding Officer (Colonel Daugherty) that there were two men out of this area that he was going to have up there (in Minn.) with him before long, and he turned to Mutt and said, \"You know who one of them is, don't you, Sergeant Jones!\" (The other is Captain Matlock.) He asked Mutt if he was ready to come up there with him and Mutt told him that it would hurt him pretty much financially to move his family to that climate at this time of year as he'd have to outfit the whole family with winter clothes. Colonel Matheny never did say then whether he was going to get orders out on us or not sooooo don't know any more about that part of it. Then a couple days later a Sergeant told Mutt he had overheard Colonel Matheny talking to a Major in Base Operations and heard the Colonel say he'd like to \"borrow Sergeant Jones for 6 months if he couldn't have him permanently. The Major said, \"No that Air Defense Command was after that Sergeant, too, and that they were supposed to get him. Now, here's the rest of the tale, A.D.C. is supposed to take over this training school that Mutt and Captain Matlock set up. A.D.C. headquarters is in Colorado Springs, Colorado, butttttt the school is supposed to remain here, only be under Air Defense Command control instead of the command that handles it here, soooooo it could mean that we'll stay here. Then a few days after all this commotion, Colonel Zackmann called Colonel Daugherty from St. Paul to tell him that Colonel Matheny had been promoted to Brigadier General sooooooo who know what power the ol' boy might have now. In the meantime we just sit tight and figure on remaining here till spring, at least. 'Course maybe we don't figure like \"General\" Matheny does, but Mutt thinks the ol' boy will let us stay here till spring. Sooooo you see we'll be here for Christmas, no doubt. If'n Erickson's are going to Omaha for Christmas, would they have room for you, too, and then you could come the rest of the way here by train. How does that sound to you?? Sounds real bright to me! It's a long drive by car, and by train you'd just have to sit back, relax, and not even steer it!!! I plan to take a vacation, whether you come to see us or not, but I'd apply for a longer vacation if'n I know you were coming for sure. By the way, in your letter you said, quote: \"They put the storm windows on and washed all the windows. Best job I ever had done.\" Unquote.! Mutt would like to argue that point with you!!! So Sadie is going to be at the Children's Hospital for Christmas this year. Just think, it was 10 years ago that I spent my Christmas there, too, at 311 Pleasant Avenue. Got my first \"Cadet Nurse\" check while I was there, too, and the bond from it would have matured in February. (Cashed it to help pay off the T.V.) Doesn't seem like so very long ago, either, and here I are, all married and with a brood of four!! Not bad progress for 10 years!!! You said Johnnie Ledfors was stationed in Hawaii. Is he in service??? Last I heard of him he was established in a detail office with Uncle Gus on Walnut Street in Riverside. So Donita has tonsil trouble, too? We're trying to get Rodney's and Richard's taken out at the government hospital here but they've cut out all dependent medical care, but told Mutt to see some Colonel tomorrow about it, because we've been calling about 2 weeks now trying to get some information and they just discontinued medical care this week, sooooo we should know tomorrow. Right now, they don't have a cold, so it would be a good time to get it done, butttttt we'll have to see what the Colonel says. Haven't heard any more from the Joneses about Uncle Jimmy and haven't heard from Grampa Jones for quite a while, either, so don't know any news from that direction. They're closing up the machine shop this weekend (night shift) so I'm moving to another First Aid Station next week. Wouldn't be surprised to hear any day that they didn't need a night nurse here. Sure would like to see the little Monger and Fay girls. Time is now 11:30 p.m. and I still have some pills to pkg. so better sign off. Come and see us at Christmas time???? \n",

      "Happy Birthday, Daddy!! Your package is sitting at home waiting for me to wrap it! Maybe someday I will get it mailed. Still, you are 64 years young today, are not you? Bet you went out to Helen's for birthday cake, too, did not you? Did you save me a piece of cake?? Didja have ice cream and coffee, too?? Hope you had a real happy birthday, anyway, and if I had been there I would have given you a lickin! like you used to give me! (It hurt, too, but did not dare cry on my birthday!!) Welllllllllllll, have the latest information and have:- I am to be on vacation from December 21st through January 1st, it will actually be from December 19th (Saturday) through January 2nd because all Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays off, sooooo I will take 8 days vacation and have 16 days off altogether!!! Now want the only reason they gave me comes off, was because I told them my folks had talked of coming down to spend times with us and it had been almost 5 years since they were to visit us before, so I got Christmas off!!! How about that!!! Now here is one request I have. Could you give me one little real hint as to whether you flew to spend the holidays in this country. Yes, then I will go ahead and take the 2 weeks off. If not, just let me know and I will only take one week and let someone else have the next week off, save that extra vacation time till next fall, when we come to Minnesota!! Ha!! Listen to me planning a whole year in advance. Oh, well, let me dream!! Anyway, I would really, truly, honestly, appreciate a little hint as to whether or not you are really thinking of coming to see us. Seems too good to be true, and do not dare plan on it till I really have it in black and white. The kids ask every few days when we are going to go see \"drampa and dramma\" (as the twins say it) and \"Bompa Chay\" as Mark says it. Got such a kick out of Mark the other day! It was chilly outside, and zipped up his jacket and he said \"Chadie pined my neck, do not her! Thought he had forgotten that, but he has not, past week I had him on my lap putting his shoes on and he looked at me so funny and said, \"Dhay!!, you bedded turn around head and let me pick those mabbaes (marbles) out of your eyes.\" I ducked before he picked my eyes out and took him in the bedroom and showed him that he had \"marbles\" in his eyes, too, so he leaves mine alone now! He is almost square, that kid! I was measuring them Saturday because they needed new sleepers and I did not want to take them to town with us and all three boys are 11 1/2 across the shoulders, while Karen is only 10 1/2. Karen is 20 1/2\" around the waist, the twins 21 1/2 and Mark is 22\" around the middle!! He is not fat either, just as solid as the rock of Gibraltar. Mutt has been under the weather these days. He has had a cough for a long time but blamed it on cigarettes and finally went to the dispensary and they x-rayed his chest and said he had what was commonly called \"walking pneumonia\" and that he would likely have it as long as he was in this dry climate. They started him on Terramycin and today he started with diarrhea from the Terramycin, so hope he goes back to the Dr. tomorrow and see what they think the next move is. X-ray showed his lungs were pretty congested. What the heck \"walking pneumonia\" is, though, beats me! I got in Karen's room today and dug it out!! It was so full of papers that I \"should not throw out\" (quote my daughter!) so I let it pile till she finally said, \"I cannot clean my room, mommie, maybe you better!\" Looks pretty sharp in there right now, but wonder how long it will last. Mutt called me tonight to tell me he cleaned the boys' room tonight, so they feel better, too. Such kids! It cannot be much longer for Helen, will it? Sure hope everything goes alright this time. I think she has the whole family sweating this time. She will have Sadie there to keep an eye on her and that should help. What do you hear from Lil since she went back to Omaha? Are they still living on the base? I wrote a letter to Frank not too long ago, but don't expect an answer till about a year from now. By the way, mom, \" mucho gracias\" forwarding me my railroad retirement slip (nope, were not a check). It is a card that is sent out once a year and who would ever have dreamed a year ago that we would still be here now!! You will probably get another one next year about now. There is nothing more in the wind about us being transferred, so guess they have forgotten us for awhile. Flo and Bernie got back from their furlough to England and she brought some snapshots backs of her mother who looks just like the grandma Ledfors!! A little heavier but her facial features reminded me a lot of grammie. They are being transferred to Sioux City, Iowa, should be on their way tomorrow. Well, it is time to pick up stuff and get ready to go home. You will let me know what you are \"thinking\" about Christmas, won't you?? Perleezze? \n",

      "Have been so far up in the clouds that I haven't been able to see straight, since we got your call Sunday night!! What happened to our connection, though? Must've gotten cut off 'er somethin', but didn't figure you'd call back cuz you'd given us the most important news. After you called I finished up the supper dishes (we ate late) and was sending the brood off to bed and Mark was sitting on the davenport. I told him it was bedtime and he said, \"I not donna do to bed, till I talk to Dramma.\" Finally convinced him that \"Dramma\" would come and see him at Christmastime and he could talk to \"Dramma\" all he wanted to then. All day yesterday the questions flew. \"Are Dramma and Drampa comin' on the train?\" \"Is Christmas tummin' too?\" And of course Mark with his, \"Chadie pinch my neck, didn't her!\" and \"Are Maghis and Gussie comin', too?\" Then Rodney pipes up with, \"I know why Drampa can't come on the train! Cuz he gots so many bossy cows on there, he couldn't get on!\" They're really wound up like tops now and suppose they will be till Christmas. Mutt went to the Px Toyland and got two llittle 16\" bicycles put back for the twins for Christmas and a doll bed for Karen. She still has to have a \"Toni\" doll. Hate to put so much money into those Toni dolls, as they aren't such good dolls and the little 14\" dolls sells for $12.00 at Sears, but the other mothers are getting their girls \"Toni\" dolls so guess Karen will have to have one, too. Mark has to have a tricycle as he's never had one and then I got a big box of Tinker Toys and they have each one pull toy (for boys) and I made some doll clothes for Karen's doll and that's going to be about it. Karen is going to have to have blue jeans and long sleeve T-shirts before Christmas, I think. It gets pretty chilly some of these mornings and I hate to send her off to school with little cold bare legs!! Most of the little girls go bare-legged even in freezing weather, but I think it's silly to send them off like that. There are enough of them that wear jeans so she won't feel out of place on cold days, with jeans on. Was so relieved to hear about little Loren Lee. Bet they're about the happiest people on this old earth. I like the name they picked out, too. Got the announcement yesterday. We won't be going to Holbrook to the funeral. I work till 1:30 a.m. Thursday and we're having company for dinner, and then I go to work again Friday at 5 p.m., so there just isn't any time. Should take time for things like that, but sometimes circumstances just won't let you. I'm still working 5 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Don't know when I'll have to start on day duty, but would like to hold out till January 1st if'n I could. I'm gonna be off on vacation from Saturday, December 19th till Monday, January 4th, so we'll have all kinds of time to visit. Mutt has to work, off and on, during the holidays, but will be able to be home some of the time, anyway. Just think...another month and you'll be here!!! I'm lonesome already! We took the kids out and got them rubber boots last Saturday. It snowed Thursday and Friday, and I'd promised the kids I'd make them a snowman, so Sunday afternoon \"we\" went out and made a snowman in the backyard. Now I can't get the boots off the kids and the yard is almost entirely dried up again. It sure was pretty, though. Especially Friday night (or rather Saturday morning) when I was driving home at 1:30 a.m. Big snowflakes were falling and the night was warm and there was a big moon. Shore was a purdy night!! Gloria and \"P.P.\" (Sgt. Paulus Prottengeir) and three boys are coming to eat turkey at our house Thursday. We're buying the turkey together and then we're going 50-50 on the rest of the stuff and eating at our house. Think it will be lots of fun. Gosh, this should really be a Happy Thanksgiving at the Drege house with their little blessing, and it really is a blessing that they got a live, well baby this time. Would sure like to see the \"big three\" when they see their new brother. They're all big enough to hold him and help with him, too. Well, maybe we will get to see him next Thanksgiving (1954) or thereabouts. Helen said he looked like John did when he was little. I still have some pictures of John that were taken in the hospital shortly after he was born. Haven't heard from the Joneses since the news that Gladys' (Mutt's oldest sister) husband died. At that time old Uncle Jimmy was being taken care of by some neighbors back in Arkansas. He has cancer of the prostate gland and it was too far advanced for surgery, so there isn't anything they can do for him. He's about 77, I think. We've got the sleeping arrangements all made. Rodney and Richard in Richard's bunk, Karen and Mark in Rodney's bunk, \"Mahjie\" in Mahk's\" bed and \"Chahley\" in Karen's bed, Grandma and Grampa in our bed, Pa and Ma on the davenport. Gosh, it just doesn't seem possible that you'll be here in about 30 days!!! Welll, I better go through the place here and see what needs to be done, so will sign off for this time and we'll actually be seeing you soon!!!  December 1st: Found this letter and one to Helen in the \"stationery\" drawer and thought I'd mailed 'em last week!! Gonna get to stay on nights till January 1st or rather till I go on vacation December 19th and then start on days January 3rd? (Monday, anyway). Boys got your letters so all are happy! About three more weeks!!! Yippeeeee!!!\n",

      "Have meant to write sooner but things have been going in circles so will drop you a few lines now. All is quiet on the western front, still have not gotten a 5 bedroom house but hope to get one and get moved before Mutt goes. Heard some good news today. One G.D. left here November 1st and his wife sailed today for Japan, as she only had to wait a little over 4 months for her port call so may have seen yeah, just maybe, we will get over their to join papa Jones in less time than we thought. Makes nice dreaming, anyway! Do you know anybody that would like to take a bunch of shots for us??? The boys have 3 Typhoids, 2 Cholera, 2 Typhys, 1 Tetanus, and a smallpox vaccinations to get and Karen and I get the same except we only get one Typhoid instead of three because we had the 'entire series before we went to Alaska. Do not imagine any of the smallpox vaccinations will take as we all have good \"marks\" from the last ones. The last Cholera and last Typhus we get at the Pmt of Embarkation so suppose we will have some sick kids on board ship. Egads!! Two weeks of water!!! It only took me three days to Alaska and that seemed forever and here this will take about 2 weeks!! That sea travel sure makes a liar out of old Sir Isaac Newton and his law of gravity, because the way I found it was: \"What goes down must come up!!\" just in reverse of his theory. I am getting \"edjicated\" these days!! Learning all about Insurance and what to do when and if this and that and the other thing happens. Never realized how little I knew about all this stuff. Learning all about how often the car needs greasing and oil change and what kind of gas and what weight oil and ohhhhhh Lordy! I am gonna be the brightest darned thing you ever saw, if this keeps up!! I have started collecting birth certificates for all of us. Now Karen and I believe I have marks but just got a letter off for the twins' records. Then have to have pictures taken for the passports (2 of each). Mutt brought home the first bunch of paper work to be filled out. It is \"application for Transportation of household roads\". Just 36 pages to be filled in and then he had to sign each one of them. Guess I fill them in in some day, there is a lot of monkey business but maybe it will all get straightened out at the right time. I will feel a lot better when we get to Japan and get settled, just to know we will be in one put for three years. That is an awfully long time that far away, but when Mutt comes back to the states then, they cannot send him back ever again at all, as we will be able to pick a base, start buying a home and just live!! We are really looking forward to Margie getting here. Suppose they will get here the 9th or 10th sometime. Stape she is bringing some music and she can play from morning till night if she likes!! It will be nice to get real music out of the piano for a change instead of what the kids and I play. Guess we will miss Fritz and Bruce again because we will be home in August and them in September this year.Their boys will be half grown before we ever see them. She saw Randy when he was about a month old and never have seen the others. She will get to see little Mr. Drege before we leave, anyway! Bet Pat's kids and Becky and Colleen have really grown, too. Just 5 more months and will see most of them! There is one thing I would really like to have before we went overseas. Would you and daddy get all pictures taken together or if you cannot get to the study at the same time, could you each get one taken separately and I could put them in a double folder to take with us?? I will pay for it if you will get it done for us and I dare say there are about six other people I know who would order one of them, too. Suppose it could be done?? I would really appreciate it if you would. By the way, I have a bay here for about ready to give away! I had just scoured and scrubbed the bathroom (walls and all) and then tank the three boys in there to show them how pretty it was and also to tell them to try to hit the water in the bowl instead of the wall back of the bowl. \"Yes, they all be really careful!! Five minutes later Richard came running out to the kitchen yelling, \"Mommie, Markie wet the wall again!! I went into the bathroom and Mark looked at me so serious I said, \"I was just trying to hit my nose, mommie!!\" Frankly, I wish he had hit his nose and maybe he would be a little more careful of where he aimed!! Did I tell you that since you were here at Christmas time that now Mark is the \"little Daddy\", Rodney is the \"Little grampa\", and Richard is the \"little Charlie\"? They concocted that themselves and when I call home at night I never talk to Mark, Rodney, or Richard anymore. It is usually their \"aliases\" and when they get mad at me it is always, \"Okay, I will not be your little grampa, anymore!\" or whichever one it is, Such kids!! I am moving back inside the tech area (in the machine shop) the 15th, so will have to leave for work about 15 minutes earlier as it is quite a little walk into the area. I will be a little busier, there, too, maybe the time will fly faster and I will not have so much time to think. It is, hmmm, time has gone by fast. It is 1 a.m. got a bunch of pills packaged and some sterilizing done, so the night was gone before I knew it. Time to go home in 1/2 hour so this will be \"it\" for this time. \n",

      "All is noisier than the very dickens (I'm in the machine shop now) and nothing to do so will send you the latest from the Jones house. Mutt called Saturday night from Cayucos. He and Dad Jones and Dad Stamper were fishing and of course Mutt hadn't caught even a fish yet! They were going to Porterville Sunday and Mutt said he'd call once again if he got a chance before he shipped out. He's supposed to sail on Sunday (Margie's birthday) so I'm expecting a call Saturday. Took Margie downtown this morning and she got her hair cut and does she look like the cute little bug!! She just talked to me on the phone and one of the neighbor ladies just sent word over for her to come over for coffee cuz she'd just made fresh cupcakes, soooo Margie and the kids were going over to \"Dottie Viningo.\" She's a lovely person. Same age as I am, has four girls (one in Karen's class) , her husband works evenings, she takes Margie to church on Sunday morning with them and next Sunday she and Margie are going to a breakfast (Communion breakfast, I think she said) after church so all in all it's nice for Margie, too. She called this afternoon and asked if \"Ava Gardner\" was there. I couldn't figure out what the heck the score was till she added, \"or does she look more like Marjorie Main (\"Ma Kettle\", in the movies!) now with her new hair style? Margie and I were just going to have coffee so she came over to see what Margie looked like and had coffee with us. Mark came in to Margie tonight and said he was going to marry Barbara, Viningo little girl that is going to be 3 on Saturday. She's a little blue-eyed red-head and Mark has a crush on her. Finally got some wash out today. We've had either sand or rain everyday for over a week, so the wash had really pile up. Took two machine loads out of the hamper, put the rest back in there till next time, and the darned hamper was still full!! Can't figure that out!! Karen's teacher took their class to the Rainbow bakery today and her teacher had said they should be extra clean (she's got a couple of beginner's that look pretty grimy) so Karen had to take a bath at noon and then she wore her yellow nylon dress you sent her for her birthday last September, and the little pink coat that Helen sent (Sandra's), and she looked pretty sharp. That little coat really hit the spot because Karen lost her little red winter coat someplace over the weekend! Checked at ballet and it wasn't there, so will try Sunday School next. Didn't think she even wore it to Sunday School, though. It was just about too small, but still was a real good little coat and I wanted to clean it and send it to Becky. she is stretching up so fast now that dresses that she had when school started were just a nice length and I've let 3\" hems out of some of them and they're still awfully short on her. It sure has been a blessing to have Margie here! No one could possibly get blue or despondent with her around!! She's sure a nitwit, reallll good kid, though and sure has matured since she was here 3 years ago. She's got so darned much good sense now! The kids idolize her and she is so good with them. Mark got mad at me the other day and said, \"I don't like anybody, cept Mahjie and Daddy!!.\" Have to go downtown one of these days and get Karen an Easter bonnet and some sandals and white gloves (Daddy got her a new purse before he left) and don't know what the boys will need. Got a pattern for little collarless suits (short pants) but don't know when I'll get them made! Their shoes will hold up for another month or so, so they won't need those yet. There's so much to do and it seems like it keeps me busy running the errands that Mutt always did! Sure was spoiled, I believe. I finally got some moth balls, so I could start on a footlocker any day, butttttt can't seem to find the time! Course Margie and I aren't near \"talked out\" yet, so have to follow each other from room to room so there won't be any lapse in conversation! Welllllllll, guess I'm about run down so will call it a day for this time. How's your blood pressure and weight coming, Mom?? See you in August (July if our post call comes for August!)  P.S. Mom, your birthday present will get up there one of these days, probably about Mothers Day. Margie just called and said to tell you she got some pictures of \"Rogene's\" wedding and is going to send those to you, too.\n",

      "We got your long juicy letter today. It was a regular masterpiece, so many pages and so newsy. Just finished a letter to Mutt. Still haven't heard from him, but guess we can't expect to till May 1st. It will be 5 weeks tomorrow since he left and it seems like that many years. Saturdays and Sundays are the worst cuz that's when we were both home with the kids. Guess we have many moons ahead of us though, so might as well get used to it. Saturday I took Karen for her ballet lesson and when I got back, there were two Easter lily plants there! I looked at the cards and one said from Margie Foy and the other one said from all the kids! Here that Margie had ordered a lily and they sent two plants and they're so pretty. There were six flowers (some buds just opening now) on one plant and five on the other!! I've never had an Easter lily before and really was floored! They're beautiful!! And the thought behind them makes me appreciate them even more. Yesterday morning Margie went to Mass at 8:45 a.m. Karen went to Sunday School with Didlakes at 10 o'clock and then at 4:30 p.m. There was a special church service for children and Karen and I went to that. Each child was to bring a flower and they had a big wooden cross, about 6' tall, wrapped in \"chicken\" wire and as the little folks came in, the ushers took the flowers and put it on the cross. It was absolutely beautiful by the time the last ones were put on it. Then two boys about 12 or 13 and a teenage girl read the Scripture and the newly organized Junior Choir sang three numbers. All the little lenten boxes were put in a big basket and blessed and then given to a Rev. Candeleria who has a \"First Presbyterian\" church and school out in \"Martineztown\", a poor settlement in Albuquerqueerque. They just called him Sunday morning and asked him to come out to the services and he was amazed when they told him the lenten boxes were for his parish. They have 373 children in the Protestant Sunday School at Kirtland so that's quite a bunch. Have no idea how many Catholic or Jewish children there are, but Margie says the church is full of youngsters every Sunday, too. Heard that there were 1500 children in the Wherry Housing Project here. That adds up easy enough because there are three of us within a stone's throw of each other and we each have four!! I didn't work either Thursday or Wednesday last week cuz the boys were all sick and running high fever, but they're all on the mend now! They're just raring to get outside, but Richard can't go out till Wednesday, Rodney Thursday and Mark on Friday. Think I will keep them all in till Friday just to be on the safe side. Richard still has an awfully harsh cough, but I keep steam running in there all night and it loosens it quite a bit. Everyone of them lost between three and four pounds during this bout of measles, but maybe they'll snap out of it, once they start eating again. Three or four pounds off the twins make them look like scarecrows, but all it does to Mark is reduce his \"beer-belly\". Don't know just what Margie is going to do about her teeth. She thought she'd have them out while she was down here so she wouldn't have to let anybody that she knew see her toothless, but believe she's decided to go to work instead. She's going to try at one of the drugstores downtown, she thinks. She seems to be thoroughly enjoying the sunshine. She cut the grass in the front yard last Friday and I looked out the front window and she was sitting out on the \"new-cut\" grass barefooted, wiggling her toes through the grass and chatting with another neighbor girl who looked equally at peace with the world. Well, there goes the whistle, so it's time to take a ten minute break. Think I'll go get a cup of root beer! I'll write you all the news on our Pappy-boy when we get it and we'll see you in August. \n",

      "There's good news tonight!! (as old Gabriel Heeter would say!) Got a letter from Mutt today (2 of 'em, in fact) and he thinks he has found a house. However, he warned me not to get my hopes up too high as it's far from settled yet. It's a 2-bedroom stucco, with shower and a flush toilet, a Japanese family live next door and a GI lives behind it. It still has to have hot water piped into the sink (it's already piped into the shower) and a larger water supply and the landlord said he would do that. Also said it's a fairly new house. Of course it will have to be government approved before he can send for us. All in all it will take a little time but it's real encouraging to know he's found something. He said it isn't the best in the world, but it's livable. After Monday's letter, this one seemed especially welcome. Monday's letter said he had been out and looked at 8 houses (all government approved) and wouldn't let us live in any of them! 6 of the 8 had officers living in them (one a Lieutenant Colonel) and he said the neighborhood itself was filthy! All drinking water had to be carried in from the base and he said it really made him mad to think that the government would approve that kind of living for the service people. He says to get an idea of what the area was like (where he looked at the 8 houses) to just drive through the slum section of Albuquerqueerque and figure it was twice as bad! This place that he has found for us is in the Japanese city itself, but is in a nicer part of the city, he says. Mutt was supposed to go to Okinawa on Tuesday and will be there three weeks. They've lost his hold baggage someplace. He thinks they must have sent it to Messawa where we were supposed to go originally. Most of his clothes are in his hold baggage, so he's sorta \"short suited\", you might say! (Ha! That were a clever ode, weren't it!!) Don't know what get into Margie today! She went to bed about 8:15 last night and got up this morning wound up like a top. I never woke up till 10 a.m. (I'm usually up about 7:00). She had two loads of wash out and some Brownies mixed up to put in the oven and had breakfast over with. Karen came home from school last night with a temperature of 101 so she stayed out of school today. I took the 3 boys and went to the Commissary after groceries and when I came back to the car, all three boys had cigars!! One of the fellows that worked in that school with Mutt became the proud papa of a new son and gave the boys cigars! In all seriousness, Rodney asked me, \"Will you 'match' them for us when we get home so we can 'moke them?.\" I told him that Charlie meant for them to save the cigars for Daddy!! Rodney already had the cellophane off his and had chewed on one end of the darned thing!! These kids!! Anyway, back to Margie and her energy plus! She called about 8 tonight and she and the kids were cleaning the livingroom and had all the furniture moved in the middle of the floor and were mopping up around the rug! I told her to stop it and she said, \"Don't stop me now! I might not get a fit of energy for a long time again!.\" Took Margie to a skin specialist yesterday. She had an oozing mess of sores under her nose and her upper and lower lips were both swollen and it was all over her chin. He said it was fever blisters and gave her an x-ray treatment and got some \"Cortone\" tablets, (I went in to the drug store and got them so got a 50% discount and twelve pills just $2.70, so it's a good thing I got them.) She also has some ointment to put on them and it's much better today. She's to go back Friday for one more treatment if it's not all cleared up by then. It really looked a mess yesterday, though. It started Friday and just spread like wildfire. She didn't get to church Sunday morning, either, because her face was such a mess. She's done real well so far as her headaches are concerned. Has had one since she came down here and she said that one wasn't near as bad as some of the others she'd had, so that's encouraging, anyway. She's also lost quite a bit of weight and is she the trim little figure now!! I told her I'd have to fatten her up to where she was when she came down here or you'd think I didn't feed her right and she says, \"Oh, no, you don't!!\" I got the lawn mowed in the front and side of the house yesterday, but the back yard needs it again. Can't seem to keep up with it! By the time I get one done the other one is grown up again. It doesn't worry me too much, though, cuz I imagine in about 3 more months we should be headed for Japan. Mutt expects to get here with time enough to drive to North Dakota with us on August 1st, so maybe he will get to see \"you-all\", too. Wellllllll, this is all for now!! Write us one of these days and give us all the latest news. \n",

      "Now I'm all confused again as to our plans for coming up there! Got an airmail letter today from Headquarters US Army Forces for East, APO 343, telling me quote: I am pleased to inform you that you are authorized to join your sponsor at his overseas station unquote. It lists us as on the \"August A N Priority List \" buuuuut also says our passports must be on file at Seattle Port of Embarkation before a port call will be issued for overseas travel ,soooo that sounds to me like we'll be going to Japan via Seattle and Alaska! Yikes! There were lots of families on the ship (U.S Frederick Funston) going on to Japan when we got off in Whittier, Alaska, so guess we must be going that way. Also I won't be coming home July 1st. Instead I'll be clearing everything away here first and going to North Dakota, then on out to Seattle. Will get to see Fritzie and Bruce that way, too, so that suits me to a \"T.\" I've got the jitters so bad just thinking of all the stuff that has to be done before I go, that I can't think straight at all!! Sure wish Mutt was here with his military brain!! He knows what to do with all this stuff and I'm just simply stumped on some of it, but it will all come out in the wash, no doubt. Papers also said we're allowed 4500# household goods soooooo I get to take my piano!!! Also sewing machine, washer, living room furniture etc. Oh, yes, and the car goes, too. Still haven‚Äôt gotten the insurance straightened out, but am going to try to get over here tomorrow to see the Corporation \"Insurance Counselor.\" That's his job, to help employees with insurance troubles, so maybe he can get me squared away with that. Will sure be glad when I get all this behind me!! Sent an airmail letter to Sears Roebuck in Kansas City to see if they can get me some winter coats for the kids, they sell them all out here on sales in the fall of the year and can't find any in town, Sears Catalogue Dept. Here in town can't even order them!! Also have to have flannel sleepers for all 4 kids and flannel shirts (esp for Karen) and blue jeans for all of us (with vulcanized knees for the kids). The jeans I can get here, and may be able to find the sleepers. I'm going to make a trip downtown and find out from one of the children's shops. They're more expensive, but if I can just get them, that's the main thing! Margie and I took all the kids over to the schoolhouse this morning at 9:00 and ah 10 am, the whole school (plus mothers and preschool kids) piled into school busses and went to the park at the zoo for a school picnic. Must have been about 9 buses and at least that many cars, so we made quite a caravan. We each brought our own lunch and it was a nice day but we were all dead when we got back. It was the boys' first trip on the bus and they were so awestruck that they just sat there and looked! They like to look at the animals and it's a pretty nice little zoo. We got back about 2 P.M. Should take the boys over for haircuts in the morning, then if Karen gets out of school a little early I could run them down to the studio's and we could get our passport picture taken, so I can get that off to Washington this week. Time is going so darned fast and the days seem so full. If I could just get moving in the forenoons I'd be alright, but it takes me till 9:30 or 10 o'clock to get both eyes open in the morning! Manage to get up and get the kids breakfast and get Karen off to school, but after that rush I have to just sit down and catch a good breath and have a cup of coffee before I can get moving and then Karen comes home at 11:30 for dinner. So the morning is shot before I know it. This is her last week of school, though, as after that it won't matter if we don't eat till 12 or 12:30. Margie has been ironing like mad!! I had a lot of that piled up and then a lot of it was hers, too, so she dampened the whole works yesterday and imagine I won't see her away from the ironing board tomorrow! Except to eat, that is, we always stop for that! Prottengeiers were out Sunday night to watch T.V. We sure enjoyed the evening, and they did, too. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were on and we laughed till we were just sick. They're sure a couple of nuts! Well, I'm about run out of gab, so will sign off this time. I'll keep you posted on \"what's with us\" and we'll see you when we get there. I'll let you know so we won't drop in on you and surprise you!! Toodle-oo for this time. \n",

      "Will try to get a few lines while and sit here getting the boys to sleep for their naps. Your Christmas box came last night and all the packages are up in a closet, and yours truly is about dead with curiosity!!! She opened the pictures of the Jellehergs and the three little Monger dolls. They are sure cute!! It was real nice to meet Everett, too. Now we know him!! The Cologne dusting powder was leaking powder so we got to open that one and all the kids went to school smelling like rosebuds! Was really thrilled over the cake and cookie decorations, because you cannot buy them here at all, so we are going to have Christmas cookies after all!! We put the chocolates in the refrigerator to stay there till Christmas because those we do not get here, either. They have plenty of candy bars, but usually no bulk candy at all. The commissary had gum drapes, caramel squares, and hard candy (not Christmas candy, but square slices of hard candies), packaged up in 1 number sacks at 32 cents a sack at Thanksgiving time and I imagine they would have more stuff in for Christmas, but I am saving the chocolates anyway in case they do not have any of those. December 1st Mutt got a wire from Clyde (brother 2 years older than Mutt) yesterday stating \"Father is in hospital. Bad condition but have hope. Will notify later outcome\". His birthday is tomorrow and he will be 75 years old if he makes the grade. Mutt's birthday is the 4th, sure hope grandpa makes the grade, but he has had so many really severe attacks and then 75 is a pretty ripe old age to battle through so many rough times. He is sure a nice old man, anyway, and seems more like my own grampa that a Father-in-law. The Red cross were checking on it yesterday so we should hear something more today. In case I do not get a letter off to Helen in the next few days, would you call her and tell her that her boy got here, too, in tip top shape (on November 23rd), tell her, too, that Pa made all us kids put the packages on the shelf in the closet till Christmas!!! Karen was so thrilled over her new dress, because now she will have a new dress for Karen, but there is one thing I cannot figure out and that is, when in the dickens did you find time to make that dress, when you have had 2 weddings in the family and all that company???? Ye gets!! You amaze me, mom, when you get so much done all the time and I get so much nothing done and all the time in the world to do it. She will have a busy month this month, though, as all R.N.'s are going to school from 1-5 P.M. from Monday. Thursday, Friday from December 6th through the 21st and then will be instructing home nursing, mother and child care, and evacuation nursing classes to dependents. It is a Red Cross course and I think it is the same as you take, mom, only they will teach R.N.'s only, as instructors, here and their big trouble is that they get somebody trained and then it is time for them to rotate back to the states and they are without instructors. They only have about 5 R.N.'s lined up (from three bases) so they still have not all they could use. Well, the housing investigation did us some good. Our rent has dropped to $136.00 (plus utilities) now and the landlord will refund us the $49.00 (total) that he has overcharged us the last 3 1/2 months. We moved up from 200 to 180 on the housing list, too, as should be on the base by the 4th of July! Ha!! Your Christmas packaging should be there by the time you get this, so let me know how it made the trip. We want to send you some noritake China, but first must have the pattern number (1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice at least) which you can get at a Jewelers I think. They have some china here, that I think is prettier than the noritake, but I do not know if it is as good as that. The China shopman says it is better than noritake and that noritake is just a big name for export purposes, but I do not know but what it might be a sales talk, so we have not done any buying yet on that line. They also have come beautiful English wool tweeds here, too. That in the PX is rationed, though. I bought 3 yards of a brown tweed at 3.50 a yard. It is 58\" wide and really is beautiful stuff. They have it on the Japanese market, too, but have not priced it there. Mutt just came home and there is no news yet from Porterville, and no news is good news, we figure. Had a long letter from Fritzie. They really enjoyed their trip, I guess. Bruce said the next time they took a trip, they would wait till the kids could drive and they would sit in the back seat themselves! She also sent a snapshot of the 3 boys and one of all the Shulers and their Fay grandparents. What is the news with Lillian? Boy?? Girl?? Both?? Had a letter from Said, too, saying they thought she was, \"stagnant\" or \"flagrant\" or some such thing. Of course I owe everyone letters again, so have not answered hers yet, either. We had company here for Thanksgiving, Sergeant Moseley and Sergeant Scott. They both have families in the states but they are not coming over here, and Mo and Scott do not go back till next summer sometime, so the two of them come up here and go a few rounds with the kids every now and then. We had turkey and believe it or not, I got everything on the table instead of leaving some of it in the refrigerator!! Seems like I did something like that a year ago!! Guess I will tackle another turkey for Christmas because it were good!! Here comes my daughter home from school. Guess I will go put a cake in the roaster oven. I have started a letter to Sadie and one to the Shulers and one of these days I will get them mailed. Still have some Christmas cards to get off, too, so better get that done, because my time will be a little shorter the next weeks. I knew you would be wondering about package and it got here with many a tear in the paper and the kids are playing \"horse\" with the rope that was around the package. By the way, we are getting the paper. I have a money order here for 2 years sub., so when you get this letter, the Tribune will be all renewed! Gotta get at that cake, will write again and thank you, thank you, thank you for that box of Christmas packages and stuff. P.S. There is a box, about the size of a shoe box, that has my name on it!! The ends of the box feel solid, it does not rattle, it does not smell, and it is 23 days till Christmas and I am about to die of curiosity!!! What in the dickens is in it?????????\n",

      "Will try to get a few lines off while the kids are down for a nap. They're \"down\", but not \"out\", yet! Mutt got back Saturday from California. Grandpa is improving again now and might get out of the hospital yet. He was in a coma when Mutt got there, but came out of it and talked to him and was doing pretty good when he left. He left here Friday, December 3 about 1 PM and was at Midway Friday morning! How about that?? Confusing isn't it?? At that rate he got to midway before he left here!! I had volunteered to go to that Red Cross nurses instructor course, and that started December 6, so I was gone from 1-5 PM every day while Mutt was gone. Mark helped make things interesting by getting blood poisoning in his little toe, but I got that cleared up before Pa got home. Wednesday we went down to the PX and bought a Christmas tree ($2.50) and Mutt got here just as we were going to decorate it Saturday, so we got it finished up real purdy-like. Friday afternoon we had an alert practice while we were at the Red Cross building, so just took our books with us and stood out in the foxhole and finished our lesson! We had alert practices all the while we were in Alaska and here we are at it again over here. Lordy!! Karen was running a temp of 101.4 this noon so I kept her out of school and she's breaking out with chickenpox!!!!! Merry Christmas everybody!! December 27. Well, I'll try again!! Christmas is gone for another year! It got here and was gone again before we knew what happened! (Inside) Mutt got a wire from Windy on Thursday December 23 that Dad Jones passed away December 20 at 4:30 PM. He must have had another attack. Christmas Day would have been their 50th wedding anniversary. He said, so many times when we were there, that he was so lonely since Mommie passed away. Mutt sent him a real nice fishing set for Christmas, mailed it November 18 and it still wasn't there when Mutt left to come back here (December 14). Mutt told him he should get it anyday and Dad Jones said that when it got there, he and Doctor Brady were going to go fishing! Mutt said that one day while he was sitting with his Dad in the hospital he turned black and the nurse sent Mutt across the street to Doctor Brady's office to get him and he came over and gave Dad a shot in the vein and he got his color back. He (Doctor Brady) told Mutt then that if he hadn't been so handy there with a heart stimulant that time that he'd have been dead. Wonder what old Dad Stamper will do now. Those two checked on each other everyday to be sure the other one was making it okay!! December 28. Will start again. Will go back to Christmas week and start with Monday. Hm, don't remember what went on Monday. Just a routine day, I guess. Tuesday went to the Top 3 wives club. (That's the wives of the S/Sgts, T/Sgts, and M/Sgts.) We were giving a Christmas party for the Bethlehem Orphanage that day, and I'm so glad I went! The children are of tubercular parents who are either dead or nearly so and in hospitals all the time. It's run by Catholic Japanese sisters and there were two American priests with the group, too. The Top 3 wives club supports the orphanage by having clothing drives every so often and each year we give all the children a Christmas party at the Top 3 Club. A GI bus goes to the orphanage at Tokorozawa and brings the children to the club. (There are 150 children, ages ranging from 2-14). Talk about well behaved children!! They were there from 130 PM to 330 PM or 4 and there wasn't one whimper or argument from any of them. They were all seated at tables and then served cake and hot chocolate. They really went after that cake and chocolate, too. There was one little girl about 2 years old that was dressed in a red skirt and a white sweater and she'd take a bite of cake and then grin the biggest grin, and after every drink of chocolate she'd grin and chocolate would run out the both corners of her mouth. She was the cutest little rascal!! After the cake and hot chocolate, the children put on a program for us. A group of children from about 6 to 10 sang \"Jingle Bells\" in English. After that another group (boys and girls) put on a Japanese dance they were about 8 to 10 years old (about 20 children) and talk about rhythm!! They had on Japanese clothes, wooden shoes (Iori's) and a Japanese fan stuck in the back of their belts, which they used for part of their dance. After that, the little folks (4 to 6 year olds) put on a skit. One of the Japanese prides translated it for us. It was the story of a Grandma who made some starch, and a naughty little bird came and got in the starch. (The bird was a 4 year old girl dressed in a Kimono and she danced around and flapped her wings like a little bird). Grandma Bird picked up a stick and started after the bad bird (all in time to Japanese music). The next scene had some more little birds dancing! And then an old grampa bird somehow came into the picture and it all ended with the \"naughty\" bird giving the Grandpa a \"presento\" and he strapped the box on his back, in true Japanese fashion, waved good bye to the other little birds and walked away. It really was cute, though. After the program Santa Claus came in, and you should have seen the eyes of the tiny folks!! They opened those tiny eyes as wide as they could and as Sally (the Japanese wife) read the name on a package, she handed it to Santa Claus and he gave it to the child that came to claim it and each child (even the 2 year olds) bowed graciously to Santa Claus and ran back to their table. Each child got a gift, which was bought individually with thought given to the age and sex of each child, and talk about excited children!! They opened their \"presento\" so carefully, loved it tight to them, and then very carefully returned it to the box it came in, rewrapped it and hung onto it for dear life!! They showed more gratitude for their one toy that they'll get than American children do for the dozen they get!! We take up a collection for the orphanage at every meeting we have and we meet every Tuesday, so it doesn't take long to add up for them. I think that any of the wives that saw the gratitude on those little one's faces know that their money is going for a worthwhile cause. Wednesday, the twins' Christmas program was at 10:30, so another mother and I went down to that. It was pretty good. Rodney's class recited \"The Night Before Christmas\" with the help of their teacher. Richard's class sang Jingle Bells and said a couple little verses. Wednesday night was our squadron Christmas party. We had \"filet mignons\" and it were good!! Well I started this last year and now it's January 3, 1955!! Gonna finish this up and mail it, so you'll know we're still alive, anyway. We've got three boys blossomed with chickenpox, and Karen doesn't have all her scabs off yet, so she can't go back to school yet, either. Richard is really covered and has been pretty sick with them. He ran a temp of 104.6 yesterday and was talking out of his head last night, but is better today. We've all got bad chest colds and I think that's part of his trouble, too. Mark only has about 4 pox and is so darned full of the devil that you'd never know he was sick. He was down on his knees in front of the coffee table this morning asking your picture if, quote: \"Gramma and Grampa you want a little chickenpox??\". He also offered to go to the squadron with Mutt yesterday morning so he could give everybody some chickenpox, but his father wouldn't let him go. \"Pa\" has never had the chickenpox and he sure steers clear of these kids and they're trying their darnedest to get close enough to him to put a chickenpox on him so he could stay home from work. We really had a nice Christmas. My Lordy, all the stuff you sent though!! I never can quite figure out how you sense what we need, but you always hit the jackpot!! Karen's dress and the boys' clothes all fit perfect! Mutt is saving his shirt for a special day. I tried to buy him one here, but couldn't get any his size. I'm real glad I found out that was a purse in that box that had me so stumped! I needed the purse and needed to ease my curiosity, too!! I got a 99 piece set of \"Kutani\" China and an electric percolator from Pa Jones. The China is really pretty. The patterns are much like the Noritaki only Noritaki is \"stamped\" China and the Kutani is hand painted. They guarantee that the paint won't come off and hold a lighted match to the design, and then wipe the soot off to show you the design isn't changed any. Sergeant Moseley sent a set home to his wife in Alabama and there wasn't one chip in anything, so they do pack them well, too. The china dealers all carry Noritaki china, but each one tells you that the Kutani China is better China but the Noritaki Co. makes China strictly for export business and therefore they get more money for it. We paid 11,000 yen (about $30.56) for the China and the same design in Noritaki China was 15,000 yen. Do you know anything about \"Kutani\" China, Mom? When you hold a tea cup in the palm of your hand and snap the teacup with your finger you get a real high pitched ring. Does that mean anything? Was the cuckoo clock in one piece when it got there?? I asked the man in the shop, how you wind cuckoo clocks and he laughed and said, \"no wind!!\" See how dumb I am!!! Figured you'd be lonesome with all the kids gone now, so thought you needed something to make a little noise!!! By the way, darned near forgot to tell you, we're in the running again!! You tell Margie that people had always said we were so much alike, but doggone it there outa be some difference!! We expect our next daughter the same day they expect theirs!!!! How about that?? Gotta go make some cookies!! Put the dough in the refrigerator to just \"chill\" it about 10 days ago!! Ha!! Oughta be good cookies! \n",

      "There! Guess that includes ye all! Please remit 5 cents in cold cash by return mail, and I will forward to you, (postage prepaid), three wild Indians!! Lordy!! Karen brought the chickenpox home the Monday before Christmas and all three boys broke out good New Years Eve. They have recovered just enough to be so full of energy and no way to spend it except by fighting with each other!! I'll sure be glad when I can turn them out to pasture!! They've still got a lot of scabs, though, so will be home another week or so (yikes!!) I thought I'd better get a letter off to you while I was still alive, because another week with these madmen locked in the house and most anything can happen. Hmmm. Guess something happened. It's the 14th today and still no letter finished. Just took another look at the slides Helen sent, before I sent them back to her, and got another chuckle out of the one of the 3 monger girls smoking Grampa's pipes!! There were several of loren Lee, too, once of all the Duges but Mama Duge, and some of Sadies and Margrie's weddings,  so now we know what Everett and Odell look like, too. Course we had Sadie's wedding pictures so we've gotten acquainted with Everett, but hadn't had a peek at Odell. He are cute, though, ain't he?? Is he French or partly thereof??? He looks a little like he might be. Got a letter from Margie saying you had lost your baby. Are you feeling alright now, Pat?? You sound like you're following in Helen's footsteps. Doesn't seem quite right. Oh shoot, got company and lost my trail of thought there!! I have more trouble getting a letter finished and have more time to write than I ever have, but can't seem to get in the mood. Nothing wrong with me either, except my digestive system has been on the blink for some reason or another (heh! heh!!) but I think I'm about through that stage of the battle, or should be in another month. Karen pulled the best one the other morning. Mutt and I were drinking  coffee about 6 a.m. and I took my calcium, iron, vitamin pills and Karen said, \"I know why you're taking pills, cuz you've got a headache.\" I told her, \"No, I'm taking pills so we'll have a nice healthy baby when our new baby comes,\" and her eyes got so big and she leaned halfway over the table and said, so seriously, \"Oh, Mommie, be sure you take girl pills!!\" Thought Mutt was going to choke on his coffee, but he told her that you took just the same kind of pills whether you wanted a boy or girl and we couldn't order a girl or a boy, but would have to take whichever we got and that either one would be nice, so she got that straight I think. I asked her if she didn't like baby boys and she said, \"Yes, when they're babies, but they grow up!!\" I'm due the same day Margie is (August 6th, so Sadie said) so I'll have a little while to educate Karen on how nice baby boys can be, too. She's so set on a sister!! January 19th. Will try again. Have all 3 boys in bed for a nap, so maybe I can really finish this, this time. The boys are still scabby!!! It takes forever for the last little scratch to heal over in this country! Claim, too, that it takes 10 months for a baby over here!! I'll let you know the answer to that one! The telephone has rung all morning or else there's been someone at the door! Got up at 5 a.m., had breakfast at 6:15, and didn't get dressed till 9:30!! I'm going to start teaching \"Mother and Child Care\" classes next week, 2 hours a day, three days a week for two weeks for Red Cross, so I'll keep out of mischief, anyway. This is the most \"visiting\" community I've ever lived in, but we're all a long ways from home and with a maid in the house (ahem!) there's no reason to stay home all the time! This is the 3rd housegirl I've had since I got over here. Fired two of them cuz they let the kids do anything they wanted to when I was out of sight, and if you think the kids didn't have a heyday, guess again!!! The girl I have now speaks pretty good English and does make the kids mind a little bit. She's slower than I am, if you can feature that, and a poor housekeeper, but when she goes home Saturday nite I clean house Sunday morning!!! She's honest, though, and keeps herself clean, so I'll probably keep her. I let her go this afternoon, and then she's coming back tonight when we go to Bingo. We've been housebound with chickenpox, so tonight we're going out for dinner and Bingo. (The \"dinner\" part is a surprise for Pa! He called and asked if I'd like to go to Bingo tonight and I said \"Sure,\" and figured all the time, I could just taste that Fried Shrimp they have at the club! We usually \"eat out\" if we go to Bingo, though, so he probably \"suspects\" it!! Got the Tribune today with \"me mudder's pitcher\" on the front page, and it had all the Christmas cards. Seems like Christmas has been long gone and here we get all the Tribune Christmas greetings. That darned Frank Hornstein! I purposely wrote a real short note when I reordered the Tribune and I told Mutt that he couldn't publish this one, but got the Tribune and there my \"note\" stares me in the face!! I also got a \"note\" back which read \"Dear Francis and Betty, This is just a little note to let you know that your subscription is now paid up to the 15th of November, 1957. On November 11, Marjorie came in and paid your subscription for the coming year. Thanks for the lovely note.\" It wasn't even signed, but had the initials BK down lower on the left. Who is \"BK\"??? Could it be that they would have liked a \"letter\" instead of a \"note\"??? Heh, heh, heh!! I don't write for publicity!! Lucky if I write at all most of the time!!! Right?? Sadie and Margie are going to shoot me if I don't write! Haven't written to them since they were married!!! Gonna try to get a letter off, though, before their babies get there!! Chuckle, chuckle!!! Sadie put an address on her last note which read, \"Everett is fine, I am fine, Junior is fine! If you want to know anymore, write!! I got a big charge out of that!! Now I'll have to write. Well, Pat, if I don't sign this off, it will get put away again and not finished, so I'm going to call a halt this time. Sure hope you're feeling better now and maybe next time things will work out better for you. You have three beautiful little girls now. They've really grown in the last two years, too! We'll be due to rotate about March or April 1957!! Heavens!! Donita will be in school then!! Toodle-oo for this time. \n",

      "All is quiet on the Eastern front, kids in school, Mark outside playing, Papasan at work, Michiko washing breakfast dishes and the electricity is cut off from 8 AM this morning (all week) so can't sew, sooo here I am!!! First of all, I have diagnosed Lester's trouble! What are you trying to do, Helen, kill the poor man?? After all, man was made to father baby humans, not rabbits or elephants!! Simply a case of overwork, says ol' Doc Jones! Now take it easy, girl, and just because you live on a farm doesn't mean that that poor man yours should produce a \"litter\" every time!! They'll be calling him \"Dynamite Drege\" if you produce more than one this time!! Please extend my deepest condolences to him and also please keep us posted on whether he's a papa wabbit or a papa elephant, which the x-ray will reveal to you!!  I'm due to go to the clinic again on May 13th. Still weigh 125 1/2 #, but weighed 120 before I got p.g., so have only gained 5 1/2 # in almost 6 months. I'm not any bigger (in the belly, I mean) now than I was at 4 months with the other kids, so guess we'll just get one baby this time. That's fine, though, cuz we're not striving to make it an even half dozen!! Whatever it is, it sure is a wild one, though! Kicks like a mule all day and all night. Before I forget it, thanks a million for the suit you sent Karen!! That girl is shooting out of everything she owns!! Think she weighs 60+ pounds, so is almost the size you were when you started high school. She's just far enough behind Sandra that everything you send that Sandra has outgrown, fits Karen perfectly. Sure nice of you to raise your family like that!! Did you know that Mark has a baby in his tummy, too?? Well, he says he has! Not only that, he always says, \"Wanna see it kick?\" and wiggles his stomach to show us how it kicks. He never misses a morning either, of coming up to me and patting me on the stomach and saying, \"How are you this morning Baby? Still sleeping?\"  At night he kisses me goodnight and then pats my belly and says \"G'night Baby!\"  Crazy kid!!   May 3rd, Tues.  Thought things were too calm around here!! Karen came home at noon with the eraser off her pencil jammed down in her left ear. Took her right to the dispensary and after 20-30 minutes of digging and probing they gave it up as a bad job and sent us to the EMT clinic at [??Team Cam??] Air Base Hospital and no more success there. Sooo she's home for a couple days and is to go back to Team Cam on Thurs. morning and they'll give it another try. The Dr. at Team Cam was so gentle with her, but said it was so swollen now that he was afraid he'd hurt her after it was sore from all the probing they did at the dispensary here and that he thought if he waited a couple days the swelling would go down and he'd be able get a hold of it then. However, he added that if there was any trouble at all with it before Thurs. morning that we should call him and he would see her before then. His attitude was so much nicer than what we hit at the dispensary here. Dottie Ellington (next door) got a wire that her mother passed away unexpectedly in Ohio and so, Dottie, being the only child and her father dead, headed for Ohio yesterday. The neighbors are all taking turns caring for the family. To-morrow is my day, so they're getting meat loaf and baked potatoes for supper. They have 4 children (Anne 8 yrs., Barbara 5, Cindy 3, and Patrick 20 months) and Dottie was afraid to leave them all here, but they're doing real well, and everyone is pitching in to see that all the children fare alright. Duke is home every evening so he puts them to bed and puts the supper on the table. He's a Lt. Col. and such darned nice people! (He's from Spearfish, S. Dak. and that explains what makes them so nice!! It's that the \"Dakota\" heritage that does does it! Ha!!). Hm, now it's supper time!! Will finish this later!! Toodle oooo.  Fri. A.M. Took Karen to Team Cam yesterday and the ear was still sore, sooo took her home again. Just got back from there again now and the eraser is out! Left here at 6:30 this morning, she had a hypo at 7:10 A.M., went to surgery at 7:30, out at 8:05 and was awake enough so we brought her home again at 9:30. Course she's still drunk and is in bed sleeping it off, but the eardrum is intact and she is no pain, so we're pretty thankful. But it will be a long time before a pencil gets near her ear again!!  Sure is a beautiful day today. Too warm for a sweater!   Yesterday was \"Bays Day\" in Japan. I cut a clipping of the \"Mainichi\" that explains it pretty well. Then we drove to Team Cam yesterday there were flags out all along the roads, and all the little boys were dressed up in their \"best\" clotes. Course there were \"fish\" flying from lots of housetops, too.  OUr floor show is over and done with and guess it was a success. We put it on at the \"Top 3\" club and twice at the Service club, that's the last of it now. Am glad it's over because it sure took up a lot of time!  What are Sandra and Jim going to sing for their solos?? You tell them to sing real loud and maybe we'll hear them, too!! Glad to hear that the pictures got back O.K, thanks again for letting us see them.  Time ran out on me again!! Gotta get lunch cuz the double trouble and their father will be home for chow in a minute now. Will sign this off, and maybe I'll get around to writing again some day. You owe me a letter now....sooo!!!  \n",

      "Lost my pen someplace so \"Sheiler v Steiler\" is writing this. Works good, too! I have had the best jelly for supper tonight on our toast! It was \"Grandma jelly\". Kids do not refer to it by flavor. It is just \"grandma\" jelly, the best in the world in our opinion. Mutt came in with the groceries the other night and I was attempting to make lefse (did not look nor taste like lefse but we ate most of it anyway), so the stinker did not tell me four packages were out in the car because he knew I would drop the lefse stuff or let it burn and first thing you know, he very nonchalantly says, \"Well, guess I can bring in your mother's package now!\" I darned near threw him out and in he comes with the packages. Think we had twice as much fun as we would have if it had come in the midst of all the other Christmas things. I do not know where to start with the thank you's! There was too much to mention everything! The twins clothes fit perfect and they wore theirs to Sunday school on Sunday and Mark wore his sweater and say but Jim changing his pants shortened for him this week so he can wear his next Sunday. Karen wore her gloves to Sunday School and services and her blouse to school. Douglas has already worn 2 pairs of his socks, and both pairs of waterproof pants, Mutt has used the ash tray and the pencil sharpener, and I have worn my blouse and nightie, so you see everything is already in good use. January 10. Here I go again. Found my pen down between the mattress and the headboard of my bed. Good thing I made the bed, I guess! Had a Christmas card with a few lines on it from Ada Mundaril yesterday and she said \"sure miss not hearing from your mother. Something must have happened when I was back there and probably I did not show my appreciation for staying, though I really did enjoy it but I was feeling so punk I could not wait till I got home. Went to Doctor right away. I did get a nice Thank you card. I was going to get something to send her, but did not get uptown. Had to go to work and to Doctor three nights a week for nearly a year and a half, so I had all I could do. Am feeling much better now.\" Just bought Karen an Easter dress today. They get their summer dresses in the winter time and fall dresses in the heat of the summer. They had one in a size 8, so I got it while it was there She has to have shoes again, too. She can wear out shoes twice as fast as the boys. Cannot get the right fit and I know that is half the trouble. She wears a \"B\" width and I had to get her a \"C\" last time and a \"D\" before that and they run over at the heels so bad because she has a real narrow heel (like her mother, father, and grandfather Fay!) and the shoes just do not fit. They got in a new shipment of shoes yesterday, and I went down this morning and no shoes her size so guess we will have to try Johnson air Base tomorrow. (if we have a car then!) some Japanese man called at noon today and offered Mutt $2000 for our 53 Mercury so I do not know if we will have a car tomorrow or not. Of course Mutt is flying today, so I took the message and Mutt does not know about it yet. Mr Fuji said he would call him back at 4 or 4.30 this afternoon. Oh, oh, I hear Mr. Douglas tuning up in there. He is the sweetest little rascal you ever saw or at least we all think so! Probably needs his seat covers changed now, he has a water cooled exhaust, too, you know! Ha, Ha!! Thanks a million again for everything!! It was really wonderful! Karen, Rodney, and Richard have letters to be mailed to you and Karen said she wrote one for Mark and they sealed it before I got a look at it, so do not know what Mark's might say. My housegirl, Humiko Sakuma, came back to work Saturday and feels pretty good today. Her knee is still a little stiff but other than that she is fine. She is sure a good girl. Must close. Hope the shock of two letters so close in a row will not be too much for you! Happy new year!!\n",

      "It is 9:45 P.m. and supposed should retire for the night, but will answer your letter first, Daddy. Two letters in less than a year??? Whew!! That's darn near too much for me!! They really are welcome, though, even more so when Mutt is gone, too, so I feel licked could lick the world right now! Nope, I did not know Frances was pregnant, good thing you keep me posted on these pregnant sisters, else I would lose track of all these nieces and nephews. Pat wrote me that she had the \"disease\" again, so now I will report in. Hope I am not in the race this time. Tell Helen I am waiting, for her. When she has her set of triplets then I will order another (she would not dare call that bet, would she???) Daughter is getting more like Karen every day. The kids were playing house with him tonight and had one of Karen's little dresses on him and it was Karen all over again. Believe his going to be left handed, too. I was just thinking today, (and pulled him out of the kitchen cupboards, out of the bookcase, out of the sewing machine drawers, out of the bathroom, etc.) I wonder what it would be like to turn Jackie, Jeffrey, Nancy, and Douglas loose in grandma's and grandpa's house, all at the same time!! I will bet you would have to remodel the house again, or else the kids would remodel it for you! I will bet that would really keep away one of us on the hap. Had a letter from Mutt and do not believe the transfer to Hawaii is going to be worth investigating. He said the living expenses there are sky high, even on the base, and that with our family we would not be able to make ends meet. Our squadron is definitely leaving this base, so whether they will transfer him to another squadron on this base or move us to another base, I do not know yet. I have been in this house ten months and I almost know where things are now, and ten months is about our limit in any one house, so reckon will move. One thing about this service life is that it never gets a chance to get monotonous! You should see our daughter!! She has the prettiest black eye you ever saw! a little three year old boy next door went to swing a baseball bat at his sister and hit Karen instead and heavens, did she ever get a shiner!! She is in a dance recital next Sunday afternoon (Japanese dance in Kimono and ballet) so hope her eye clears up by then. That is mother's day too, and Mutt will miss them both. Last Friday night the Brownie had their Father Daughter banquet and Sergeant McKnight came and took Karen to the banquet because her Daddy was gone. He even bought her a corsage and was she thrilled! They have two boys and no girls, and Frances said that it just tickled Jimmie to death to think that Karen asked him to go. He had even signed the corsage card himself and Frances said that he sat there, five or 20 minutes trying to figure out what he could write on the card that would be just right and when the card got here it said, \"To a very pretty little girl, from your substitute to Dad Jimmie McKnight\" Oh, before I forget it, I finally got your Mother's Day, Father's Day (I am early on that one, mind you!) and mom's birthday present and the picture frames off to you, so you can expect a little box in the mail one of these days. Mutt will be real proud of me, to think I actually got those picture frames in the mail!! Lordy, the hands on that clock are running round and round!! It is 10.45 noon and our youngest alarm clock goes off between 5.00 and 5.30 A.M., Darn child figgers that if it is time for the sun to come up, it is time for him to get up, too! Thank heavens we are not in Alaska where the sun would be coming up about 2.30 or 3 a.m. now. P.S. What is uncle Sig going to do now, Mom? Live all by himself? Had Aunt Numidia had any heart trouble before?\n",

      "While the bottles are boiling for formula and the big kids are all outside playing, Pa is at work, and Dougie asleep, I'll start a letter. Don't know how far I'll get but I'll start, anyway! School is out for another year and we all passed! Karen made the \" high honors\" this time. She's been on the honor roll all along but had all A's except one B this time so was on \"high honors.\" Mark made all S's except for 2 O's (outstanding( In punctuality and dependability and the twins had all S's except Richard's I in handwriting which he has had all year. His handwriting has improved so much since school started and is just as good as Rodney's but his teacher left the I there, anyway. They're planning a summer vacation program here again this year but the prices are outrageous. Last year the entire program cost $1.00 per child and they went from 9-11 a.m. Of course those who had children taking Japanese dance had to buy Kimonos, Labi's and fans for their own child, but the registration was just $1.00 per child. This year it's $3.00 per child to register them. Then each subject is from $2.00-4.00 extra. I figured swimming lessons and just supervised play for this year would be $20.00 in comparison to the $4.00 it cost last year, so we're not even going to register them at all then there are a lot of others who are doing the same thing. Yesterday we went for a ride and some of the countryside is so pretty now. We took our camera and took some pictures. Hope they turn out good. We've taken quite a few of the nice paddies but I want to get some of the people and babies and of the open vegetable markets. Now for the lastest squadron news. Our squadron moves to Johnson A.B. the last of this month (26th, I believe) but the Joneses and the Baranovskis will stay at Yakota and the Sgt. and the Capt. will have to drive back and forth every day because they don't have housing for the likes of us. Baranovskis have 6 (expecting their 7th) and they have housing for people with 3 children (at Johnson A.B.) so will stay put and Pa will travel back and forth every day. We're debating now about whether to come home next March 17th or extend till June 17th so the youngsters can finish school first. Some of the children have failed this year due to coming over here from the states in the middle of the school term and missing too much school, so I sure don't want that to happen. We have to make up our minds by September if we want to apply for a 3 months extension, so we have a few more months to think about it. We took Dougie to the barber shop Saturday and now he has changed from a baby to a baby boy. He had on that corduroy suit (with the vest top that you send for Christmas) and talk about a cutie! He knew it, too!! He was so pleased with himself and thought he was quite the rosehead! We had our house DDT'd last week and what a mess. They said they'd be back every 30 days this summer, but I hope they were kidding. We had to take everything out of the closets, pictures off the walls, food and dishes out of the cupboards and then they went wild with the DDT gun. We still have some roaches and a few ants, but they're not too bad now. Thing I'll go take Dougie for a stroll in his stroller while the eggs boil for potato salad because it's kinda cloudy so that means it will probably pour down rain this afternoon. This is the wettest darned country I've ever seen! How are my P.G. sisters doing?? and how many P.G. sisters do I have now?? (Nope, I'm not among 'em!!) Last account said it was Pat and Fritzie, anymore joined the list since then??? Believe I owe them all the letters, but am counting on you, Daddy, to keep me posted on them!! Gotta get going, but just wanted to let you know we're O.K., alive, and kicking, etc., etc., etc. all healthy, no ailments, not even corns or bunions, kids missing a few teeth, mother missing a few marbles in the supper story maybe but otherwise all fine and dandy!! Be good and we'll see you in 1957. \n",

      "While the washer swishes the clothes around and Dougie saws logs and Karen works in her Arithmetic workbook and Mark writes his 1,2,3's, and the twins build forts out of the cut grass, and Pa is at work at Johnson Air Base, I'll scratch off a few lines to you. First off, thank you for the powder. At least, he's not allergic to that. He still has the heat rash, but it's not as bad as it was. It's just a climatic thing, I guess, and as long as I can keep it from getting any worse, that's the best I can do until we get out of this country. Can't use ointment on it as it just seems to act as a good medium for the bacteria to prosper in and the humidity here is so great and the ointment seems to hold the moisture and instead of drying it, it develops into a fungus that looks like a weeping eczema. The Japanese children have it bad during the summer and the Doctors have come to the conclusion that the bacteria is airborne. We're due out of here March 17th and we're going to go ahead and go home then and hope we get assigned somewhere in the western half of the U.S. so we can get the kids right back in school. It only takes 36 hours to fly from here to San Francisco, so if we fly they won't miss much school. We won't get any furlough time until June, but if we have any cash left by then, we still plan a trip to North Dakota in June. The squadron moved to Johnson Air Base a couple weeks ago, so guess we'll have to move over there before school starts. Mutt drives back and forth now. Leaves here at 6:30 and gets back around 5:30 or 6 at night. He has joined the Masons, too, so is busy studying that stuff (whatever it is, it must be a deep dark secret because all I get out of him these days is \"name, rank, and serial number\"! Ha! Had Karen's hair cut short and she's to get a permanent this week. She wears glasses, too, so she doesn't look like the same girl at all. Dougie is walking all over the place now. Started two weeks ago and is really on his own now. He can't get up when he falls in the middle of the room, but crawls over to a wall, or chair or something, gets on his feet and off he goes again. I don't know who was more excited the day he took his first steps, the bigger kids or Dougie!! His vocabulary is getting there, slow but sure. Says, Daddy, Mama (it's been Baba up until the last week), \"wichad\", Katie, bye bye, and nite nite. He still has just 6 teeth and no sign of any more yet, but seems to use those six to good advantage and eats everything he gets his hands on. He doesn't seem to get into any more trouble now that he's walking and seems like his clothes don't get quite as dirty. Just doesn't seem like he's been a baby very long at all! (No, we haven't ordered another one yet!) Had a letter from Helen yesterday and one from Pat a couple days ago, so here I am behind on correspondence again. I just about get caught up and then everybody writes at once and I'm way behind again. Well, peoples, it's 11:15, so reckon I'd best fix some lunch for this tribe. Usually have our big meal at night now that Mutt is gone at noon, so it will be sandwiches or soup or something like that now. Now, you owe me a letter, Girl!! Sure nice to know somebody owes me a letter, because it's usually the other way around. Love that Nancy for me and we'll be up to see you next June (11 months, that is!!) PS note our new address!\n",

      "Will get a few lines off to you so you'll at least know that we got here. We left Fort Mason on the 12:30 (noon) bus on Friday. Arrived at Travis A.F.B. about 2:30 p.m. and were sent to the dependent's lounge and an airman came to the lounge to process us through the red tape and he checked our baggage and then we were on our own for 1/2 hour.There was a Major's wife traveling with two little girls (3 and 4 1/2 years old) and we were the only unaccompanied dependents. At 4 p.m. we were to line up for our gate passes and also sign and pay 75 cents for an inflight lunch. Dependents always go first in line, ahead of officers and airmen. Mrs. Meyer picked up her pass and paid her 75 cents per lunch and then the Sergeant at the desk said, \"Mrs. Meyer, this is Lieutenant Cook. He is assigned as your sponsor from here to Tokyo. He will call for you and your family and baggage at the dependent's lounge at plane time. He will take care of you for the duration of the trip and if there is anything you need help with, just call Lieutenant Cook and he will take care of you. He will board the plane with you and seated across the aisle from you and at each step, will accompany you to and from the plane.\" Well, I was next in line and was introduced to Lieutenant Cooper and got the same information on him. It really helped, too. When we stopped anyplace and let the kids down to exercise their legs, our sponsors helped keep an eye on them and \"walked\" them around the terminals and think I appreciated most of all not having to lug that zipper bag along with everything else every time I boarded or got off a plane. We left Travis about 5:30 p.m. Friday and arrived in Hawaii at 1:30 a.m. Hawaii time (3:30 a.m. San Francisco time). Dougie got sick when we were a couple hours out of Travis and heaved all over everything. Luckily, I had 3 sets of shirts and pants for him, because he messed up 2 sets something awful, and the third time he heaved, I was a little more prepared and caught it in a disposable diaper. (Got a real charge out of my \"sponsor\" when Dougie heaved the first time. Boy, Dougie heaved one big splash and Lieutenant Cooper ran like a scared rabbit, to the front of the plane and never did come back to his seat across the aisle until I had everything cleaned up and under control and Dougie asleep again! Lieutenant Cooper is an only child I found out later), just got engaged before he left home, and had just been in service a week or two so guess he wasn't used to such behavior from a baby! Wasn't used to babies, period!! We were in Hawaii 3 1/2 hours, so took Dougie to the dependent's lounge, took his temperature (102) and gave him a baby aspirin and got him to sleep for on hour. Left Hawaii at 5:00 a.m. and got to Wake Island at 2 p.m. or something like that. (Anyway, it took us 10 hours ++ from Travis to Hawaii, 10 hours from Hawaii to Wake Island, and 7 1/2 hours from Wake Island to Tokyo.) Stayed in Wake Island 1 hour 15 minutes Dougie got diarrhea enroute from Hawaii to Wake Island and is still running a temperature of 101 and has kept his breakfast and lunch down today. We arrived in Tokyo at Haneda International Airport at about 8 p.m. Mutt wasn't there to meet me and I couldn't figure out that out. They sent me directly to the dependent's lounge and when the airmen came to process me through red tape, he took one look at my orders and his mouth dropped wide open and he stopped dead in his tracks and said, \"Gosh, Lady, I just did an awful thing! Your husband called and I told him you weren't on this flight.\" Then he took off like a bird and went and called Mutt, and then they sent me to Osaka Ha! missed this page. Hotel in Tokyo and we waited there for Mutt. Sergeant Graves \"baby sat\" with the kids while Mutt got a staff car and came after me. We got home here a little after eleven p.m. Mutt walked the boys to school Monday morning and I went with Karen to get her in the right room, so they're all squared away now. We plan to extend till May 17th, so we'll be heading back across the big pond in 8 months. I called the school principal and if children go to school here through May 1st and their grades are average or above they will automatically be promoted to the next grade and we won't have to reenter them in the states until the next term in the fall, so that's the reason for staying 2 more months. We got here at 11 p.m. and by 2 p.m. the very next day Dougie was all broke out with heat rash all around his neck and shoulders like he was when I left here with him, so guess it's back to washing him with baking soda water again. Thursday, September 13, 1956 Will finish this off and get it mailed. Dougie has been sick ever since we got here and is so weak he can scarcely walk. Have had him to the Doctor twice and he's on \"Terramycen\" now, and looks a little better this morning. His temperature is only 100 this morning and it has stayed from 101-102 ever since we were in Hawaii, so believe he will be o.k. now. He is so pale, though, and has lost a few pounds I believe because his face is so thin looking. He ate a good breakfast this morning so expect he will be back to his own sweet self in another day or two. He doesn't have much \"zip\" yet, but is much more alert than he has been and we've gotten a few smiles out of him this morning, so believe he has it made now.Mutt leaves next Monday (17th) for Formosa for 35 days. He was supposed to leave Friday but their orders were changed till Monday so we'll have him here 3 more days. It's 8:30 a.m., so guess I'd better get on the move here. Have so blamed much to get straightened out here. This housegirl seems pretty fair, slower than molasses in January, but good personality and speaks good English so maybe she'll be worth her salt after while. At least I can get to the commissary while Mutt's gone. Well, you people be good now, and thank you for taking such good care of us'n while we were there. Hope you're not overdoing, Daddy. You, too, mom!! I sure enjoyed myself there and wouldn't trade that trip for a million dollars!! It's good to be home, though, too. Gotta go! PS Everything fit to a T. Kids wore new shirts to school the first day and Karen would wear her nightgown to school, if I'd let her! She models it for everybody that comes to call!\n",

      "Just about supper time, but the boys are all outside playing, so guess I can gab for a few minutes. Mutt left yesterday morning (3:30 AM.) for Formosa for 35 days, as I is a widder again. Finally have all the kids on the mend again. Dougie has been sick ever since we got back, but yesterday and today seems to have perked up and is pretty much his old self again. September 24, yeah, yeah, yeah!!! Didn't get very far did I? Started to tell you about the kids. We had 5 of them sick with headaches, vomiting, and fever for 5 days, but they're all 100% okay now and back in school. It was some virus that was making the rounds. Think Mutt had a touch of it, too, but was alright when he left here. Me?? Sappy, I'm the tough one, I am! Guess I'm so old and tough that the viruses don't even fool with me! Just put Dougie down for his nap and am going to the commissary in a few minutes. I'm real brave and will drive the car as far as the commissary, but that's it! \"Rat and Rodent Control\" fellows were just here and set traps and poison upstairs in the attic. They've found evidence of rats and have had traps set in the kitchen at night but they eat the cheese and the traps stay set, but maybe this time they'll do some good. They tell me that rats come up through the toilet bowl and then out into the house. Yikes!! It's bad enough seeing their calling cards, but if I ever see a rat I'll just curl up and die!! They give me the creeps! Must go to the commissary so will quit this and try again later! September 27, 1956, Here I am again! The Rat and Rodent boys came back Tuesday morning and took 5 dead rats out of the attic and I had them plug up the Japanese toilet off the kitchen because they were leaving muddy tracks into the kitchen and were bypassing the traps and this morning we haven't seen even one calling card, so hope have 'em whipped. My housegirl is quitting. Says she works too hard here and I just laughed at her and told her to go ahead and quit if she thought she was overworked, but for her to remember her contract reads she will give a two weeks notice so I'd expect to see her here for the next two weeks or I wouldn't sign her release for her. She has breakfast and lunch here, and it's 9 o'clock before she even gets started with any work and then she sits down to have a cigarette whenever she feels like it and is out of there by 4:30 every day and most of the girls work till after supper, so she really gets by easy. She makes no beds, does no cooking, no sewing, and has waxed floors once since I've been back and that's almost 3 weeks now, and I we wash up the supper dishes and sweep up the dining room and kitchen at night, so she's not overworked. I can get a houseboy to come in and scrub and wax all the floors, and wash windows and blinds one day a week for 500 Yen ($1.50), so think I'll do that and do the rest myself. We drove to Camp Drake to the Px before Mutt left and they really have the children's clothes here this fall. Got Karen several nice cotton school dresses for $2.50 each, and got winter \"sur-coats\" for the twins for $6.25 each and still have to get Mark one, but will have to try Yakota for his, because they don't have any size 6's at this Px and an 8 is just too much too big. Got a letter from Mutt yesterday. He was in Taipei (capital of Formosa) and was going to leave for \"Elan-eu-pi\" in the southern port of Formosa the day (September 20) that he wrote. It takes just as long to get a letter from Formosa as it does from the state and the only time he can mail a letter is if he is in Taipei, so don't expect to hear again for a week or 10 days. It's pouring rain outside. They're catching fringe winds from Typhoon \"Harriet\" and sometimes they get pretty strong. Later: September 28, Lordy, walked out to kitchen and there was a rat standing on my kitchen sink! I hollered \"Judy\", and she came running and the rat took off! She turned that kitchen inside out and never found the rat. Than about 3 P.M.  Judy was out in the kitchen and she saw him run under the refrigerator, so we each got a stick   and I found him in the back of the refrigerator and he took off and I took a swing at him (Plan on signing with Yankees next year because I hit him square in the head on the 1st strike!) You should have seen the kids scatter (no school after lunch because of the typhoon)! Richard had Dougie and he set him on the floor like he was a hot potato and ran for the front door! Karen jumped in a big chair and darned near knocked the chair and all over. Rodney and Mark were both up on top of the back of the diner and when they saw I'd killed the rat, they all walked out there real cautiously and started with their mouths open and Richard said, \"Geeeee, Mommie, I'll bet daddy will give you $50.00 when he comes home cuz you're so brave!!\" Ahhhh, I am a heroine!!! We've searched the whole house today and not a sign of rat dirt anywhere, so maybe we have them all now, I hope!! I'm going to sign this off this time and take this over to Sgt. Mosier's and see if Frida will have him drop it in the mailbox for me. The typhoon was all over by 5 P.M. and the sun came out real pretty yesterday. Hope you're behaving yourself, Daddy, and Mommy how's your blood pressure?? Would you have it checked for me and report it please!! Sure enjoyed every minute I was home!! Gotta go!! Say \"hello\" to all the kids! I owe 'em all letters!\n",

      "It's 10 p.m., kids are asleep, Pa still in Farmosa and quieter than heck around here! Just got the September 13th and September 20th issues of the Tribune today, so all the housework stopped immediately till I'd read the papers and then I got company from next door (they're Nesei, (Jap American from Hawaii A.M. citizens and ed. in Hawaii)  and such nice people) and then Madeline called me and we yacked awhile, and Frances McKnight called, and we yacked it up, and then we had supper, and the kids all had their baths, then Dougie went to sleep, then the 4 big kids and I tooted at the piano awhile and then I read them a little book and then they all retired for the night and here I am!! I talked to Mrs. Shillito (her husband is the officer in charge of the Farmosa trip) yesterday and she said she'd had a letter from her husband saying they'd be home the 15th and I've heard every car that has gone down the street today, and guess they're not going to make it on the 15th as they only have 1 hour and 15 minutes to go and then the 15th will be gone. I wrote a letter to Pat and Don last night and of course, that's still waiting to be mailed, but at least I got it written. I've been doing my own work for a week now and thoroughly enjoying it. Keeps me on the move, especially to get to the Commissary every other day for milk and bread, but I've been waiting till Karen comes home from school and then she baby sits with Dougie and we make out alright. The kids have really pitched in and helped since we got rid of the housegirl and we just get along so much better without one of them. I think she wanted to stay because she really pitched in and worked those last two weeks but I was tickled to death to see her go, and I don't expect to have another one at all now. I can use that $25.00 a month to better advantage, anyway.Forgot to tell you that I put $3.00 in that red \"note\" box by the telephone before I left there. $2.00 was for my calls to Bismark and $1.00 was for Pay's drycleaning bill on a dress of hers I wore and spilled something on. Finally got Mark a winter jacket and got caps for all three boys so they're all set now. Also got some Japanese made, all rubber boats for the kids at the Px for 20 cents a pair. They were selling them out, so I got them each a pair. Mark's are quite a bit big, but figured I'd splurge and spend 20 cents for him, too, even if they were a bit big. Also got Karen two pullover sweaters and a flannel nightgown for her for Christmas. Got myself a pair of flannel p.js, too. First time they've had women's flannel p.j.'s and I sure was glad to get them. They really have the Px's stocked now, though, especially in children's clothes. It's still hard to get wire nylons, but they'd have them on the counter before Christmas I'd imagine. They have plenty of seamless nylons but I don't like them, and guess no one else does either because they sure don't sell. This Dougie of ours is a corker! This Nesei lady from next door looked at your picture on the piano and said \"Is this your mother and Dad?\", Dougie stood there having a fit and yelling \"Bampa, Bampa, Bampa\". He points to Grandma and says \"Bampa\", and then he points to Grandpa and says \"Bampa\", so he's kind of a mixed up kid, but he sure knows who it is, anyway. Oh, Heavens, Daddy come ship this darned bellowing cow that's out across the back fence here!! She \"moo's\" half the night here sometimes. They think that's where our rats are coming from is from the Jap. barnyard across the back fence here. They've taken 12 rats out of here so far. They don't have any signs of any downstairs now thank heavens, but they still take them out from the attic or under the house. These rats don't seem to bother the Japanese, but they sure give me the creeps!! They don't bother me now that they're out of the downstairs, anyway. There goes that darned cow again!! Maybe the rats are after her! Well, guess I might as well hit the sack. These kids really get up early around here. By the way, Pat said Frank was home. What gives?? Are they moving to Minot?? Got my curiosity ariz now!! Tell him to join the Air Force, we only move about once a year now!! Suppose you two are behaving yourselves like the doctor said to and that Daddy is taking life easy?????? That's a good kid! I knew you would! Welllllll I started to say good night once so I'll say it again . I'm hungry now, though! Hmm. Guess I'll go peel an apple. (I'll take a dish of \"Maple-nut\", Mom, out of the freezer! Thanks!) Ahhhh, to sit and watch TV and eat ice cream (of some other flavor than strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla)  that's the life for me. G'dnight again!\n",

      "Breakfast dishes on the table, clothes washing away in the machine, Dougie's toys all over the living room, our bed \"un-made\", ironing hiding in the closet, ohhh, all kinds of things waiting to be done, but there's no one around to say \"Hurry, Betty\", so I'm not hurrying. Got the Shuler's birth announcement a couple days ago. How about that??? Helen, Fritz, and I all with 4 boys and 1 girl apiece! and beyond us, girls, girls, girls! Am anxious to see what Pat and Don get now, and keep watching for their announcement in the mail. Hear tell that Sadie is in the running again. Wonder who'll be next! Not us, thank you!! Haven't mailed your Christmas package yet, but one of these days before December 25th, I'll get it in the mail. November 20, 1956, Same year anyway! It's almost 9 bells and all the boys in bed asleep and Karen in the process of getting there, so I'll try to finish this tonight and maybe, now mind you I said \"maybe\", I'll get it mailed tomorrow. Mutt left this morning about 6 A.M. and should be back Wednesday nite and then be home Thursday (Thanksgiving) and then leave again Friday about 6 A.M. and maybe come back Saturday night and be home Sunday and then Monday ???? Wellll, I haven't all the details any further than that yet. I still don't have your Christmas package ready to mail yet, so will bid you a Happy New Year instead of a Merry Christmas to know you open the package because it will never reach you by Christmas now. Finally conceded defeat here and called the labor office to see about getting a housegirl. Hate like sin to have one around the house but with kids coming and going all day to and from school there almost has to be someone here when they come home and it's almost impossible to shop for groceries and carry Dougie and get back in time to unlock the house for the kids, so finally decided I'd give it one more try at having a housegirl. There are quite a few girls looking for jobs now, anyway, because the Service has finally clamped down on G.I's living off base with Japanese girls. Now, if a G.I. is caught living with a Japanese girl, he gets an \"unsatisfactory\" efficiency report which means he can never be promoted and never re-enlist. Also now if a G.I. wants to marry a Jap girl he has to get his Commanding Officer's okay, and when a G.I. goes to his Commanding Officer for such permission, it is the Commanding Officer's unwritten duty to transfer the man so far off he can't marry the girl, if he unable to talk the boy out of getting married. These G.I. Jap marriages aren't working out and it's all too evident the girls will marry any G.I. just to get a passport to the states, and finally the service is realizing their responsibility and clamping down on them. Still haven't heard anything on those Warrant Officer exams Mutt wrote, but Air Force Times states that they have over 600 applications and are only going to promote 200, so we won't know until the 1st of the year what the outcome is. Mutt figures he won't have as good a chance at making it now, as he only has 4 1/2 years to go until retiring now, and a man with more years service to give to Uncle Sam will have a little better chance at it. He really had some wonderful recommendations on his papers, though. Base housing called and said we'd be moving within 90 days as they're going to re-floor a bunch of the houses and of course this would be one of them. First they have to find a place big enough to hold us and that's a purdy big job!! Keep hoping they won't find a place to move us into until May and then we go home, anyway. May isn't so far off, either. You should have seen these kids tonight. The boys take pure delight in trying to kiss their sister good night and she gets madder than a hornet and fights like mad, as a rule! Tonight Rodney thought he'd play the diplomat, so he brought two marbles out here and said, \"Karen, I'll give you these two marbles if you'll let me kiss you goodnight.\" She was sitting here working her Arithmetic and instead of the usual fight and temper, she calmly reached out and took the marbles, held out her cheek for Rodney to kiss her and when he kissed her, she went right on with her Arithmetic without so much as a second glance or a word at all. Rodney kissed her on the cheek, and stepped back expecting the usual fight and when he saw that he'd gotten to kiss her and she didn't try to slug him one, he just stood here dumbfounded and finally walked off into the bedroom still scratching his head! He never said a word, but betcha he was figuring he'd just lost two marbles without so much as a good fight for it! These kids really keep life interesting around here. They're teaching them Japanese in school this year so they come home with a few words of Japanese each day now. Don't suppose they'll learn it well enough to get any good out of it, but they enjoy it, anyway. The kids all brought their 1st report cards home and all had very good report cards. Karen had all A's and B's and the boys are still being graded with \"S\" for Satisfactory, \"I\" for improving and \"N\" for needs to improve. Richard got all S's except one I in handwriting. Rodney got an I in 2nd grade reading, and Mark got S's. It sure is quiet in here! When all the kids get off to bed and Mutt is gone, it gets so lonesome and quiet sitting here that I end up heading into bed and going to sleep because I can't stand the peace as well as I can the noise. Sure am glad we got Dougie, because he breaks the silence around here all day. That's not all he breaks either!! Lordy! He climbs like a monkey! Found him in the middle of the dining room table the other day and he had one of those rubber plate scrapers and a dish of butterscotch pudding and was he having fun!! He just slapped pudding in every direction!! He can get on top of the piano, too, and up on the kitchen cupboards, but so far hasn't mastered the refrigerator, for the simple reason that the surface is too slick and there are no knobs to get any footing on, but I expect to see him up there now. He really is the big wheel around here and does he know it!! Wellllllllllllllll it's 5 after 10 and the kids are up and at em about 6 in the morning or earlier, so I'd better retire for the day because I'm getting older and need my sleep you know. Hope you both are behaving real well and figure you must be or someone would have reported you by now!! I have my spies at work there, you know! We'll, be seeing you in a few months (3 days less than 6 months to go now, you know!! Gotta get to bed! \n",

      "I'm in the bad graces of my children because they wrote Grandma a birthday letter and I haven't mailed it yet!! If I wait much longer we'll be home before the letter gets there!! That would never do. Did you have a Happy Birthday Mom?? Don't suppose you ate any cake seeing that you're on Daddy's diet with him. Did you??? You two will be so thin we won't know you when we get home! We still haven't heard where we'll be going or just when. We should get our assignment in the next 10 days or so but the port call we can't look for until the 1st of May. We're really getting anxious now. We'll let you know right away when we get the good word from Uncle Sam. I have the prettiest house! I just dampened down my ironing and believe if I start now and keep ironing I should be caught up by tomorrow at this time. Can't seem to keep up with it. I just took better than twenty shirts and blouses off the line and the blue jeans are still out there as they'll be ready for the iron, too, in a little while. My dishes are waiting in the kitchen. Keep thinking if I wait long enough they'll all go away, but they're still there every time I pass by the door! Can't figure them out! I sold our electric range last week. They're building a lot of \"private owned'' houses here on base and they are entirely unfurnished, so didn't have any trouble selling it. A Lieutenant Colonel Smith bought it. He and Mutt went over to lodge together one night and he needed an electric range and we had one to sell, so he bought it, just like that. His wife is a past matron in Eastern Star. There's been a siege of Strep throat going the rounds, so they ran throat cultures on all the kids in school and Karen had the germ in her throat, so had to take Penicillin for 5 days. The rest of them were clear. Dougie had pinworms, too, so have been \"soap suds enema\" ing him. Took a stool specimen to the lab and it came back negative, so they wouldn't give me any medicine for him, but I know he had them because I saw them. I'm going to have them run another stool specimen this week and see what they find. Rodney, Richard and Mark took turns with the Pink eye, too, and they're all back in school. The day I was to send Mark back to school when his eyes cleared up, he fell with a hollow steel towel rack in his hand and ran the darned thing down his throat. Really bruised the soft palate and uvula and skinned part of his tonsil pretty bad and on down the back of his throat, but he's in the clear again now and eating everything again (except towel racks) so guess he's O.K. Took him to the dispensary and they gave him a shot of tetanus and sent him back to us. As for your ruptured diaphragm, Daddy, I'll guess right along with you as to what they will do after they get you all thin and trim again. It's been so long since I've been around the hospital that I don't have any idea what they'll do about it. I have a solution, though! Send you to England for awhile!! Why??? Because one of the couples from here went to England from here and wrote back that gas was 84 cents a gallon over there, so you see you couldn't afford gas if you were over there and with no gas your stomach would stay where it belonged!! Or do you suppose they might have been talking about a different kind of gas???? Oh, Heavens, here's Mark home from school already and there's Richard behind him and suppose Rodney's about half block away. That's the end of the peace and quiet for today. Must sweep the floor, wash the dishes and then proceed with my ironing. Time sure flies! Hope you had a Happy Birthday, Mom! Love to you both from all of us, Betty. March 3st. Well, well, your letter is still here!! Might as well add a bit to it. The dirt is blowing thick as soup and the 4 older ones are out there playing and are they dirty!! Rodney came in and I took one look at him and told him if he was coming in to stay, to go right back to the bathroom and get in the tub. Well, he didn't want to stay in, so he left again. He looked like some coon! Mutt left for Nagoya this morning. Should be back about Thursday Friday. There's some big conference up there. Our assignments come in there before they come here, so he's going to see if he can find out where we're going when we head for the good ole U.S.A. That Dougie of ours is a little bear today. He growls every time anyone looks at him and growls if you don't look at him. He has an eye tooth that has been coming through since we were home in August and it still isn't through. The spit runs like a river, too. April 2nd no assignment yet. Gonna mail this. \n",

      "Dear Folks, Just a few lines (while my coffee is cooking) to give you our address. There 'tis, WO Frances and E Jones 138 W. Mountain Los Cruces, N. Mx. We're in a great big house, almost as big as yours! Pay $100.00 plus utilities, so we're looking into something a low down payment and might buy, as this will run pretty steep over a period of time. We have a big kitchen, living room, dining room, three bedrooms and bathroom downstairs and two huge bedrooms upstairs with a sink in each bedroom upstairs and in one bedroom down here. Also have a screened in front porch which is wonderful for Dougie. We're ideally located here, too. 1/2 block to drug store, 1 block from main street, 3 blocks from swimming pool and theater, 3 blocks from supermarket. Should like to have this as our own, but know the down payment would be clear out of reach because of the location of the house. It's just what we need with a big family, but it's an old house and would take quite a bit of fixing to get it in shape. There are hardwood floors all through the house and it's partly furnished. Guess it was really filthy when Mutt got it, but he got two women to come in and clean the kitchen and wash and wax the floors before he came up to get us, bless his heart! So at least we could have a clean place to eat. He said the grease on the stove was almost an inch thick, so I'm sure glad he had that cleaned for me. There still is a lot to do, but we have lots of time and nothing better to do. Our furniture got here about 7 P.M. Friday, just two hours after we did, so that was real nice, too. Haven't unpacked your china to see if any is broken, but will leave that up to you. Do you want us to mail it to you or shall we keep it for you till Christmas!!! You are coming for Christmas, aren't you? We have plenty and I do mean plenty of room here! Just got our phone connected Saturday and our # is 6-9645. See Alex Du Puis' are listed in the directory, too, but haven't called them yet, but I'm going to one of these days soon. Must go get dressed, but did want to say, \"Good Morning\" and to give you our address, phone number, etc. and tell you we're looking for you at Christmas time. If you want those dishes before then, just holler, and we'll send them on to you before then. Gotta go. P.S. We are eating peach jam on our toast, thank you, Grandma!! Forgot to tell you what a time the kids had with the dollar Grandpa gave them. The minute Mutt stopped for gas, the kids were out of the car to see if there was anything buy and of course there were Cokes and pop of all kinds and think they still have a few cents left. They had more fun with that dollar than anything else they could have gotten. Ah, yes, and Mom, remember I looked all over for that gray cap of Dougie's??? Well, I found it yesterday under the front seat of the car!! Must go this time.\n",

      "It's 10:20 a.m. and the kids have piano lesson all morning, so I'll drop you a line while they're busy.  They start at 10 and usually last til 12:30 p.m., so it's a long session, but she breaks Mark's and the twins' lessons into 15 minute sessions so they won't tire up it so much.  She drove out to our house yesterday and they have started putting up the framework and we just about can't wait for them to finish it.  Then we have room for you, you say? Ah, yes!! We have 3 bedrooms and a den.  There will be a double bed in our room and me in Karen's room, 4 bunks in the baby's room, a divan that opens up in the den, and then our 2 piece sectional can be used to sleep two kids if we need to, and the twins have sleeping bags, so we can squeeze in 14 if need be.  The rooms aren't real large, but big enough, I think.  Yes, I'm working again, but only till we get some things we need for our house.  We already have an electric range paid for and all of our refrigerator but $135.00 and that will be ours the middle of August, so bit by bit it will be our and we'll have it all prettied up by Christmas!  I'll probably work till Christmas, but by then we should have a new living room set, bedroom set, spring and mattress, stove and refrigerator and wall around the back yard, so it will be well worth it.  We got our contract in just in time because the price of houses like ours has gone up $475.00 since we bought it, and ours was the last contract signed before VA allowed them to raise the price on them!  The kids are excited as we are and we drive out almost every day to see how much progress they've made on the house.  We got a Pierce County Tribune in the mail yesterday and I believe our subscription had run out about May if I'm not mistaken so we were surprised to get it.  Maybe they just sent it to remind us we needed to renew it!  The kids were all excited when they saw the $3.00 in the letter and Mutt told them that Grandma sent that to pay for our new house, so they think you own part of our house now!  So Daddy paid for the family pictures!!  Well, now, Daddy, are you looking for a licking???  That will run to quite a bit won't it when it's multiplied by 7???  See, you really paid for starting all this about 36 years ago, didn't you?  What's more, it can't be undone and you're stuck with all of us!  Ha!  Guess you've had some of this heat wave up there, too.  Right after we get here, it hit about 104 or 105 degrees for days on end and cooled off very little at night, but its nice now.  Only about 99 degrees, starts out at 86 degrees around 7 a.m. and \"warms up\" after that.  Hear tell that it gets cold in November and stays pretty chilly for the winter months.  Our house has an air cooler in it when it's completed and hot water heater and electric wall heaters, so we don't have those to buy extra.  We have cement floors with asphalt tile on them, except the utility room and that is just plain ol' concrete.  Hmmm, seems to me no matter what subject I start on I always end up on our house.  Guess I'm going goofy!  I had Sunday and Monday off this week so head back to work tonight.  Really enjoy the work, too, as its all sick babies and don't go to work till 5, so it works out fine here.  We get one day off one week and two the next.  Well, guess I'd better get on the move here.  Ye olde clock just keeps going round n' round while I sit here and go on and on!  Since I've started this letter we've had dinner, kids are finished with their piano lessons, Dougie is asleep and Karen and Richard have gone to the store after milk (and popsicles, shshh, they're not fattening!)  We're really looking forward to having you with us for Christmas!  Maybe this time I'll remember to put everything on the table!  You forget to answer one question, though; will you need the dishes before Christmas??  If so, let us know and we'll send 'em.  If not, we'll just keep 'em here till Christmas.  Dougie just got up and brought me his shoes and is standing here saying, \"Dougie shoes on, Mommie. Outside! Outside!\" so I'd probably better go help him!  We'll be seeing you at Christmas!  Tell Charlie not to bring his horse with him, cuz we still don't have yard enough for a horse and no hay either!  Ha!  Toodle-oo, for this time!  \n",

      "Must get a few lines off to you in order to keep peace in the family! DuPrees' stopped in Saturday morning on their way to El Paso to see Johnnie and said that you were flying in here the 15th. The kids heard them say it, and talk about excited! Threatened to put a muzzle on the boys, but they didn't know what a muzzle was, so my threat didn't do much good. The three big boys have had the flu since Thursday night, but all went back to school this morning (Tuesday), so hope they're through with it. Karen stayed home this morning because she had a headache, but gave her an aspirin and put her back to bed and she is going back at noon now. Felt sorry for the boys because they each had their turn at trying to figure out which end to put over the toilet bowl. They ate nothing but tea and toast and milk for two days and guess it did the job. They were feeling pretty good yesterday and getting pretty rowdy so decided either the boys went to school today or I was! We've sort of expected you to pop in here any day now. If you decide to fly in, we'll meet you at El Paso, just give us a buzz. Got a letter from Pat and not a word about whether you were coming or not, so decided I'd better break down and write and find out. I've worked at the hospital a lot of the time during Christmas and New Years and still go in when they're short of help. It shows in the house when I work, but we get behind it all every once in awhile and shovel it out! I have one load of wash on the line and another in the machine! Bless these automatic washers! I can write letters while the wash is getting done. We're going to El Paso tomorrow. Mutt has to go out to Biggs Field on business for the radar site, so Dougie and I are going along just for the ride. My washer just turned off, so it's time for me to get busy. Come and see us soon! I hear every car that goes by and every little airplane that buzzes overhead! We'll be looking for you! \n",

      "Time has flown by like magic again! Been thinking about you so much and wishing you were here! The weather has been beautiful. 78 degrees for several days now, and it's so hard to stay inside and work when it's so beautiful outside. Everyone has spring fever and are out digging up flower beds, and planting trees and lawns. We put in a climbing red rose and Mark has a flower bed planted. It's a children's flower bed mixture so don't know what might show up. He loves to dig and plant and build, so is in his glory when he's digging. The twins were talking big, too, about planting a garden, but someone said baseball and they forgot the garden and went off to play ball. What do you think of this bow tie with a boy attached? We think he's a pretty nice kid! (He thinks so, too!) Have been looking for a frame to put the 5 of them together in, but so far, no luck. Haven't tried the photo studios though, and they could probably get something like that for us. We never have a family picture taken so it's nice we could get the same photographer to take Dougie's, too. I didn't like Richard's and Rodney's pictures too well, but thought the other three were real good! The McKnights finally got here from Japan. Got here at 3:45 am Thursday and left 9:00 am Friday, so didn't stay long, but Errick had to get back in school. Sure was good to see them, though! Think Dougie is getting the measles. He was exposed a couple of weeks ago and started with a temperature of 102 degrees yesterday afternoon, but it's only been up to 100.6 degrees today so will have to wait and see what develops. Can't see any spots yet, but we're looking for him to blossom anytime now. What's new up North Dakota way? I'd like to run up for a cup of coffee right now! Got the coffee pot on? I've been trying to figure out some way for someone to drive your car for you so you could come and see us, but so far haven't come up with any solution! Maybe there's a G.I. at Minot or Fortuna or Fargo or Grand Forks that hails from this neck of the woods and wants to take a 30 day furlough 'er something. Then he could drive your car down here and back up there. Only one thing wrong with that is that he'd have to come pretty highly recommended to trust him behind the wheel of the car with my Ma and Pa in it! Believe you'd really enjoy the weather here now, though. Karen is giving the program for her girls scout group today, so she took her kimono and records and 35mm slides and her fan with her today. They have to have a foreign speaker or someone who has visited a foreign country and Karen is the only one in the group who has been overseas so she gives the program and gets credit toward a badge for it. It's good practice for her anyway, I think. Well, reckon I'd better go iron. Dougie took a nap with both eyes open today and spent the time looking out the window and taking the laces out of his shoes! He's such a busy fellow when he sleeps with his eyes open. He doesn't know it, but he's going to bed early tonight! He was up at 1:30 am and again at 2:30 am this morning and I worked so didn't get to bed till midnight so thought he'd sleep this afternoon and then I would, too, but he fooled me. He's just as good natured as if he'd had a good night's sleep and a long nap but can't get mad at him when he's all smiles and happy, so he won this round. He's a good politician, that boy! Write sometime and come and see us when you can.\n",

      "Swore I was going to just stop and write to you on your birthday, Mom, but got company that day and don't know what has happened since then. Can't seem to find many spare minutes and still don't seem to get half of things done that I'd like to. First off, the box came the 13th, and talk about excitement!! The bedspreads went right on the beds and when anyone comes in the door, Dougie says, \"Come see my bed\", and repeats it till somebody pays attention. They sure make the boys bedroom look nice! Got a kick out of the twins. I was helping Mark and Dougie put their new spreads on their beds and Richard and Rodney were helping each other with their spreads. They just started to unfold it and Richard said (solemn as a judge), \"Don't drop this Rodney! It's as precious as the American flag!!\" He meant it, too! The twins shirts fit perfect. Mark's was long in the sleeves, but he had to wear his to Sunday school last Sunday, so I turned the cuffs up and he wore it. It will fit him perfect by next fall. He's at that \"in between\" size now and is hard to fit. Karen was especially pleased over the North Dakota coin purse. She had been after me for a long time to get her a coin purse to carry her Scout money in and I'd just never remember it when I was downtown. The socks were super! She needed some and I hadn't gotten those, either. She's worn the gloves to school every day and believe when it's 100 degrees in the shade, she will still wear them. She has read the \"ballet\" book a couple times so I know she liked that. She's not much of a letter writer so don't suppose she will ever get a letter off to you. She has the speed of her mother, and now I know how I must have irked you when I was growing up! She is so slow that I could give her a swift kick in the pants most of the time, but find out she does much better if I can count ten and leave her alone and just not watch her!! We have the pillows on the couch in the living room and they look so nice. I didn't have any pillow at all on the couch and that was a future project that I'd probably have accomplished about 1960, so I'm glad you sent them and I'll just cross that project off the list. Have used the cheeseboard every day (didn't have a breadboard, that was another future product!). Used the \"egg separator\" and that works like a charm! The \"Red River potatoes\" flour scoop is in use, the dish towel in the drawer, and the measuring cups!!!! They're beautiful! Don't have them on the wall yet, but they'll be there! Well, Daddy, does Mom look any older now than she did a week ago?? Did you get any birthday cake, or are you on a diet??? I got up to 125 pounds and my uniforms were choking me around the middle, so cut down my starches for about 10 days and am back to 120 pounds and can breathe in my uniforms again. We are having a cement block wall built around our yard. The sand is all blowing away and we had to do something to save our property or we were going to have a house sitting on the foundation with no yard left. It will be nice when it's finished, but is party expensive. Sure am glad I have an education in a field that is in demand and that I can work evening hours. I'm only working part time and get $14 a day (for 8 hours) so it's not bad. They're so short of help that I can name my own hours and my own days, so that helps. We've started the kids in the little Lutheran Church here. It's just a few blocks from our house and they just started a junior choir and all of the kids are singing in it. The woman who directs it obviously has had some voice training because they don't just \"sing\", they first spend a few minutes singing up and down the scales and she kept saying, \"Now don't slide up and down from one key to another.\" Reminded me of Fritzie and I and \"Ciribiribin\"! I can still see you, Mom, sitting there on the old davenport with your eyes shut, listening, while Fritzie and I went over and over it till we quit \"sliding.\" I planted a pan of tomato seeds and holy smokes, every darned one of them grew, so I just got the last of them transplanted yesterday. Soooo I have tomato plants enough for the whole squadron and most of the neighborhood. Oh, well, we all like tomatoes. Mutt got some posts and a couple pieces of pipe, so it won't be long till the kids have a swing and a chinning bar in the back yard. We have so many things we plan to do to this place if Uncle Sam just leaves us here and it looks like he will. We're really enjoying ourselves here and just love our location. I know we'll hate to leave here when the day comes, but we don't even think about that! Still haven't finished Karen's Easter dress and she has to have it next Thursday for their Easter program at school. Maybe I should get to work. I have the breakfast and lunch dishes soaking. I'm real talented at soaking dishes!! Everybody has a talent you know and that's mine, soaking dishes!! I cleaned, scrubbed, and waxed the whole house yesterday except the kitchen and everything looked so nice. Have to get the kitchen done now while Dougie is sleeping. If only it would last! The sand here is awfully hard on the wax or maybe it's just so many feet going across it all the time. Well, do you suppose I should get busy?? Hate to! I'm real comfortable here in the rocking chair with my feet on a footstool, but guess the floor won't wash itself and reckon the dishes are pretty well soaked by now. I go to work at 5 tonight. Work 5 to 11 tomorrow night, too, and then am hospital supervisor on 3 to 11 Saturday and Sunday. I didn't work last Sunday and Gladys and Willie Holmberg (down the street) and their kids and Pa and I and our 5 went mountain climbing. It was lots of fun, but didn't realize how \"soft\" I'd gotten from lack of such exercise. The kids really enjoyed it and Dougie \"hiked\" most of the way on Mutt's shoulders and when we got to the car he said, \"Oh, I'm so tired, Daddy!\" And Mutt said, \"You're tired???\" And Dougie said, \"Yes, Daddy, I'm soooo tired.\" He was, too, but it sounded so funny coming from him when he'd been carried almost all the way! That darned Mutt never puffed at all! Guess he ain't as old as I tell him he is!! Here I am turning gray haired as the dickens and he came up to me one day and asked me to pull out the one gray hair he had in his head!! I just said, \"Won't do it, son!!\" Oh, well, people will think he's a nice kid to take such good care of his \"Mother\"!! Ha ha ha ha!! Gotta get to work or I'll get fired! Your birthday present will come with your Mother's Day and Father's Day package, Mom. Hope you had a real real happy birthday!\n",

      "Just to keep you up to date with the Joneses, here goes!! We're  being transferred to Albuquerqueerque the first of June! Mutt just called and told me and now I can't think straight. There's so much to do and don't know where to start. Imagine we'll move into Wherry housing again and it's much smaller than our house here and this house is full to the roof. That means lots of sorting out and trying to figure out what to do with everything. Such is life! We like Albuquerqueerque but sure hate to leave our house here. Hmmmm maybe we'll put the house on wheels and move it with us. We haven't told the kids yet and won't for awhile, till we have the orders on paper. In the meantime I can sort and discard and figure and figure and figure on what to do with all our accumulation. Stuff sure piles up fast! Rodney and Richard are home with the 3 day measles. Mark had them 2 weeks ago, so suppose Karen and Dougie will wait till 2 weeks from now. I have every other weekend off and we try to go someplace each weekend I'm off but the kids and the measles have fixed up the past weekends I've had off and it would be just like Karen and Dougie to wait till the next weekend I'm off. Must tell you what I did a couple of weeks ago!! Now, only an Irishman that was half Swede could possibly pull something like this!!! I hitched a ride home with one of the nurses and her husband and got clear up to my door before I discovered our carport was empty and then it dawned on me that I had driven the car to work so they had to turn around and drive all the way back to the hospital so I could drive the car home! I'm telling you, I felt like 2 cents waiting for the change!!! Mutt often drives me to work on Saturday and Sunday and then comes and gets me about 11:30 pm or midnight and this happened to be a Saturday night that he didn't drive me to work. I'm still living it down at the hospital and every night when it's time to leave someone says, \"Jones, did you drive your car today?\" Ahhh yes old age is creeping up on me! I've gotta get busy. I go to work at 5:00 pm so I've got to get busy and get the dishes out of the way, and wanted to make some pajamas for the boys while I have them here. They want short sleeve, short leg pajamas, so I'd better make them before they change their minds and I don't have enough material on hand for long legs on them. Just thought you'd like to hear the news about us moving people. One thing about it, we'll be 226 miles closer to home so a few more transfers and we'll be on your doorstep!! \n",

      "Hold onto your hats!! We're working on plans to come home next month. Guess the phone call spurred me on!! Anyway, we plan to leave here Friday the 13th about 5 PM and try to drive straight through, if possible. We'll make a bed in the back of the station wagon and we can take turns driving and sleeping, so it shouldn't be too bad. The kids are so excited that I don't know if I'll keep them from starting to hike down the road or not! May 27. Got that far and the phone rang and it was you, Mom. Was so surprised to hear about Uncle John. You sounded so exhausted, too. I just sent a card and letter off to Aunt Vic. Mutt was afraid that all of us coming up there would be too much for you on top of all this, but we'll try hard not to add too much to the load you already carry. I work from now till Thursday night the 12th and we plan to leave here Friday the 13th as soon as Mutt gets off work and drive till we get there. Have to be back here for Mutt to go to work the 30th. The kids go to Bible School June 2 through 13, so that will keep them off my car with \"How many days till we go see Grandpa and Grandma?\" I didn't plan to tell them we were even going until we were about ready to leave, but with all these ears around here we don't have secrets very long. One of the nurse's little girls is staying here these two weeks too. She's the same age as Karen and it's real good for Karen. Her mother picks her up at 5 PM and leaves her here about 8 AM. She's a real good kid and we're really enjoying her. Well, I've got a million things to do, all of them ironing! Or I won't get to go see my Mama and Daddy! (Frankly, it's not the kids that are excited! It's us old folks! We're worse than the kids are!) We'll see you soon!!\n",

      "I'm waiting for the wax to dry on the living room floor, so will drop a line while I wait. Dougie is sleeping and the other 4 have gone swimming so it's peaceful. Darned hot, too! We had a nice trip. Got home at 10:30 pm last night. It was pitch dark and the first thing Mark did was to go look at his flower garden to see if he had any more flowers in bloom. He couldn't see a thing, but came in satisfied and said it sure looked pretty! Think I had that 24 hour flu Tuesday night. Got sick before we got to Rapid City and felt like h(ades that is) the rest of the day. We spent the night in Cheyenne, Wyoming and then came on in yesterday. We ran into hail just before we turned onto the highway at Steele, North Dakota and it rained on us the rest of the way, so it was nice and cool traveling weather. It snowed on us in Cheyenne, but was gone by the time we left the next morning, then by the time we got to Raton, New Mexico, it started to get hot and the closer to home we got the hotter it was in the car, so it was a good time of day to get in here. Dougie got the bright idea of spitting while we were traveling and I told him to stop it a couple times, so the third time he spit I popped him one and was he mad! His daddy laughed at him because he was mad and Dougie stuck that lower lip out half a foot and crossed his arms on his chest and said, \"I not Mommy's boy and I'm not Daddy's boy! I'm just Grandpa's!\" Five minutes later he reached over and kissed me on the cheek and gave me a big hug and said, \"I'm your boy Mommy\" and did the same to his dad and said, \"I'm your boy, too, Daddy!\" Such a nut! We really enjoyed our visit up there! Don't know what information the kids may have passed on to the neighbor kids about farm life, but imagine if they've been giving out too much information I'll hear about it sooner or later. They really think they've been to the end of the world and back in the last two weeks and to hear them talk, nobody else has ever been to North Dakota before except them! I'm sure glad we made the trip though. Believe I enjoyed it more this year than before because it was the first time I've gotten there without being dead tired all the time. Last year we were so tired from traveling so darned far (about 4,500 miles or so) so this wasn't so far this time. Then, too, I didn't have a small baby to hold and that really makes a big difference. Hope you've slowed down a little mom and gotten some rest since we left. I could tell you were really getting bushed before we got out of there. Hope your blood pressure didn't go soaring up. The lunch was super duper. Still have a little summer sausage in the refrigerator. We'll have that for dessert one of these days! We had noon lunch out of the lunch box both days we were on the road and just stopped to buy pop to go with it. Tell Helen the buns and cookies were delicious! Didn't know she had sent the cookies till we started to eat lunch and then found them. Well, the wax is dry, and then some, so I'd better keep at it. Must have had some sand storms while we were gone because there was quite a bit of sand here and there. The house was full of crickets too, so am really digging corners so they won't get in our clothes. Can't figure out how they got in, but bet we've killed 30 or 40 and they're great big things. We'll get them though or die in the attempt! And we're pretty hardy creatures, so it'll be tough on the crickets! Thanks a million for putting up with us because we really enjoyed our visit! \n",

      "Just a few quick lines so I can get this off in the mail. Mutt got some Meticorten for you mom, so we're mailing it today. I wrapped it up in your Mother's Day gift and it should be there in a few days. Now! This is important! This stuff is dangerous if it is taken without a doctor's order, so please take it to Dr. O.W. before you take any of these to be sure they're the right dosage. I don't like to send anyone medicine without first talking to the doctor to be positive of an okay, but Mutt said you were paying 35 cents a pill for them so we're sending them to you, trusting you'll show them to Dr. O.W. and check with him before you take even one pill. These didn't cost us anything because you're my mother and we got them through the service. They usually won't dispense stuff like this without a prescription, but I knew the medics here real well and they're taking my word of honor that they're for a legitimate purpose, so hope you can use them. If you need more, just drop me a line and we can get you another bottle, but these are 100 to a bottle so should last awhile. I have another bottle of them here at the house and if you don't need more, I'll return them to the medics, but will keep them around till we are sure you can't use them. Can't tell, maybe O.W. will take you off them before you've used 100, so if you need more or if he discontinues them, well let me know and I'll take it from there and either send them to you or back to the medics. I worked last night and work tonight and tomorrow night too. Mutt took the kids to see the fireworks last night and Dougie has been telling me about the big firecrackers there were last night. Made rosettes yesterday and were they good! Gonna make another batch Monday as I have about six wives coming Tuesday morning for a board meeting and think they'd be just the thing to serve with our coffee. Gotta go. Will write a longer letter, but wanted to be sure you checked with O.W. before you took the pills. \n",

      "Will start another letter to you and maybe finish this one. Have 25 minutes before I'm due to leave here for work, so will have to make this short and sweet. I owe everybody letters again, but will catch up someday. I've been working quite a bit since I came back and it seems like the hours go by so fast. Never get half accomplished that I say I'm going to. The kids have been taking swimming lessons at the college every morning, so Dougie and I are alone till 10 o'clock. Don't know what he's going to do when he is alone and all the others are in school. He's just lost here the one hour they're gone in the mornings. Have to register the kids for school the 29th of August. 2nd and 3rd graders are only having 1/2 day of school. One bunch goes from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and the other group from 11:30 5 p.m. so hope Mark gets in the morning class. He's the one that needs a full day, too, but it can't be helped, I guess. Too many kids and not enough schoolrooms. Took the boys downtown Saturday and got shoes for all 4 and one new shirt for each of the 3 big boys, and I'd already gotten 8 or 10 pairs of blue jeans so they should be about set. Then Windy's girl sent a big box of clothes that Sharon had outgrown, so I won't have to get much for Karen, either. Dougie takes the hand downs and isn't big enough to know the difference. He and Mark had their own birthday cakes this year. Usually I bake one cake and decorate half for each, but they wanted their own, so I baked a 2 layer cake and decorated each layer separately and were they excited. Had to light the candles twice on both cakes, it was so much fun to blow the candles out. They both got a pair of undershorts with the pretty print fronts and Dougie had his on and was down the street to show Danny his new pants before I caught him. He thought he was all dressed up pretty, too, even if all he had on was the pretty underpants. Wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't showed everyone that they had a hole in front like Daddy's, too!!! August 21. The mailman is due by here in 20 minutes so I'm just gonna mail this as is. Had a letter from Margie saying you bought a power lawn mower, Daddy. That orter be fun to run after!! Rodney is our grass cutter here. I have finally gotten grass in both the front and back yards now so it's looking pretty nice now. Oh, you should hear these kids talking about Grandma and Grandpa and Uncle Lester and Uncle Frank and Aunt Margie and everyone coming for Christmas. They're thoroughly convinced you're all coming for Christmas and each one has a different sleeping arrangement figured out. Dougie must have been taking it all in, because the other morning he and I were eating cereal (the others were watching morning cartoons on T.V.) and there'd been not a word mentioned about Christmas and all of a sudden Dougie took his spoon out of his mouth and said, \"Mommie, Frank has three girls and they're gonna sleep in my bed and I'm gonna sleep on the table.\" It took me a minute to figure out what the heck he was talking about. Then it dawned on me just who he was talking about. The kids even worked hard one morning clearing tumbleweeds out of the empty lot next door so there'd be room for the bus to park there. Don't think the boys will ever quit talking about \"Uncle Lester's Farm.\" That, I know now, is the greatest place in the world!! I was getting after Richard the other day because he was fussing about having to pick up something that wasn't his, so I told him he could leave and go somewhere else to live if he didn't like it here and he said, \"Oh, hey, mother, could I go to Uncle Lester's??\" Gonna miss the mailman again if I don't get going here. Oh, by the way, did I tell you I wrote to Frank Hornstein and the girl at the Tribune had charged us too much. The Tribune is still $2.50 for service people instead of $4.50 so he extended our subscription 9 months so everybody's happy. Hope you're feeling fine, you two, and if you need more meticorten, Mom, just whistle. I have it here. \n",

      "While I'm waiting for all my children to go to sleep, I'll start a few lines. Have my big 4 in school and my other 3 in bed! Aha, you thought we just had 5 didn't you? Well, it's this way…Mrs Cowart (another registered nurse) and I are working for a doctor now in his office. She works one week and I work the next, so it all works out real well. She has two children, Billy 7 years old and Bobby 2½ years old so I baby sit at my house the week she works and the next week I work and Dougie and Mark go to her house. Billy and Mark both go to school in the afternoon session (11:00 am to 4:00 pm) so they're home till 10:30 am in the morning and after that we have just the two little ones here and they're good company for each other. Think this job is going to work out better all the way around for all of us because I'll be home every evening and also have Saturday afternoons and Sunday off and all the holidays, so will have more time with my monkeys here, too. The kids can't get over the fact I'll be home every night! We were in the kitchen when I told Karen I was going to work for Dr. Gay and would be home evenings and weekends now. Rodney was standing there and said, \"You mean you'll be home every night for a week!!!\" I told him, \"No, I'll be home every night!\" and he said, \"You mean every night every night?\" I said , \"Yes.\" And he went on the double back to the boys' bedroom and I heard him say, \"Boys! Mother is going to be home every night now!\" The other two echoed \"Every night??!\" and came out to the kitchen and I explained it all over again to them. I still work Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of this week at the hospital, but that is the last of that. We'll be off at noon Christmas Eve and New Years Eve too. That week of Christmas is my week to work but with Christmas Eve afternoon, Christmas Day, Saturday afternoon and Sunday off, I won't be putting in many hours there and will be home the week before Christmas and the week after, so don't let this stop any plans for your coming this away for Christmas! This setup is almost too perfect because we don't have any baby sitting expense and we're both scared something will happen to blow up our little scheme here. Her husband works for Civil Service, so they're not apt to be transferred, and of course we keep telling ourselves that we are going to stay here forever, but can't tell when Uncle Sammy might change his mind. We just dream and pretend we're going to be here forever and keep adding stuff to the yard! It really does look nice now with roses, petunias, nasturtiums, cosmos, zinnias, marigolds all in bloom and grass in both the front and back yard and Mutt put in a pyracantha bush yesterday (green bush with red berries) so it really looks good here. Why don't you come and see it? Oh, yes, we have a peach and plum tree in the back yard that don't seem to be growing worth a hoot, but have three Balm of Gilead poplars in the front yard they're growing faster than the kids feet and that's pretty fast growing you know. The kids have choir practice tonight, the boys have Cub Scout pack meeting tomorrow night, they all have scouts Wednesday night right after school and then I work Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, so this will be a hectic week, but next week will be better. Almost forgot to tell you that we have 4 new kittens again. We gave away the one white kitten we had left out of the last batch just a week before we got 4 more to replace the one we gave away! Didn't gain much by that transaction! They are the cutest little things, though. We have two white ones and two tiger striped ones this time and they look like a healthier bunch than the last ones she had. Guess I'd better sign this off 'er the mailman will go by here before I get this out on the mailbox. Gotta bake and frost a cake, too, to send out to the radar site at 6:30 am tomorrow with Mutt. Besides that I'm half asleep! Hope you both are behaving yourselves! We are! Our halos are shining brighter everyday! Ha!  P.S. Just read this and see I didn't explain the 3 children I have home today, Billy was feeling under the weather this morning, so he stayed home with me. Think he has the flu, but a light case if it is. \n",

      "No, we're not in Mississippi. Just happens that this is all the paper I can find, so will use it. Just put Bobbie and Dougie to bed for their naps and want to see that they're asleep before I go out to bring the clothes in. They have such fun if I don't keep an eagle eye on them till they're asleep. They're really a team and have such a good time together. This has been my week off, so I have two plastic bags of dampened clothes waiting for me to iron (ironed all the steam iron stuff yesterday), have three loads of clothes on the line and other machine full ready to go out, but no more line space. Karen wants a Halloween costume made tonight too, so I have an old sheet out, ready to make either a chef or a skeleton, don't know which. Dougie gets Mark's costume and Mark gets a new one this year. The twins had new ones last year. Gotta get 4 dozen cupcakes baked and decorated tomorrow, too, and over at the school by 3:00 pm. My whole house needs vacuuming again. Mutt vacuumed it Sunday morning and I got the kitchen, den, one bath and hall scrubbed and waxed Tuesday, but still haven't finished the rest. I go to work again next week, so the week I'm off is a mad one, but we really have an ideal situation with this job. At least we know when we're working and don't have to be afraid to answer the phone anymore. Do you have any snow yet? It snowed here in the mountains yesterday. Didn't get any here, but the mountains make you shiver to look at them! How are you going to celebrate your birthday, Daddy? Wish we could come up and give you a birthday spanking! I'm just about out of practice! I take a swing at the boys every now and then but lordy, I'm half dead for a half hour after I've paddled them, and five minutes after I've paddled them, they've forgotten it, so I've resorted to more drastic measures like restricting them to the yard for a week, and a yard gets awfully small and confined when the other kids ride by on bikes and play ball in the vacant lot and they sit and watch from the yard!! Mom, I have the prettiest chrysanthemums and I'm going to have to thin them an awful lot this fall, so you better come and get them about Christmas. Wonder if they'd freeze up there? They really are pretty though, and every yard has some of different colors here. Several of the neighbors are going to swap plants with me this fall, so we'll all have several shades of them. I have pinkish-lavender ones by the dozens and then some yellow ones and some maroon colored ones, sure would love to give you some of them. Do you suppose they'd freeze if I sent them through the mail? They aren't ready to transplant yet, but will be by Christmas time. Major Quinn (our commanding officer here at the site) is being transferred to Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts as of December 15th. They have 5 children (4 boys and a girl), so don't envy them their trip across country at that time of year. His dad is a doctor in Boston, and her dad lives there, too, so they'll be closer to home anyway. Gotta get the clothes in before it snows on them. Brrrrr it's cold!! We're all fine here. Not even a runny nose in the bunch! Might be the calm before the storm, or it might be that I've been feeding the kids vitamin pills since school started. Believe it helps too. You two be good now, and you have a real Happy Birthday Daddy, and we'll be thinking about you! \n",

      "Suppose soon as I start this my little monkeys will wake up from their naps and then I quit writing. Decided I wasn't making much progress here anyway today. Got the kitchen washed and waxed this morning, so all the floors were clean and shiny! Then I got company. The lady is so nice, but her two year old got in a mud puddle and with mud an inch thick on her shoes went all through the den, hall, bathroom and the boys' bedroom and even got on Dougie's bed and put his clean pillow on the floor and walked back and forth across that, dumped the box of crayons, walked on those, took one crayon and colored on the floor. Then while she (mother) went out in the backyard to get her little boy to take them home, the little girl walked across my coffee table and all over the living room rug with those nice muddy shoes and when her momma suggested they go home I didn't urge them to stay! After they'd gone, I went out to empty the garbage and there in the bottom of the garbage can were the four little kittens. Sure hope they come back soon!!!!!! I try to clean the whole house real good the week I'm home so it will be easier to keep up the week I work and thought I'd really made progress, but here it is Friday and after my company, I'm ready to start right where I started last Monday! Tra-de-da-de-da! Karen called about 1:15 pm and asked me to bring her another dress. She was playing baseball and ripped her dress and was wearing her jacket in school and was about to melt so I took her another dress. It's a real hot day and I know she must have been about melted with her jacket on. The principal (a lady) said it really wasn't torn so bad, but that Karen was too embarrassed to wear it without a jacket. Mutt has gone to Roswell today on business, so won't be back till late tonight. Hope they don't have any plans to transfer us over there. I asked him if that was what he was going for and he said, \"No, this is business!\" So know about as much now as I did before I asked him. Just as well he doesn't attempt to tell me because radar and electronics just don't register in this thick skull of mine and I'll have to admit it isn't the teacher because manages to teach other people all the time, but this one here is a dumb one and can't be teached that there electrical stuff. Visited school Tuesday since it was education week and got in Mark's room without him even knowing I was there and talk about a gentleman! He was good as gold and really tending to business. Must have been there fifteen minutes before he happened to turn around and see me sitting there and thought he never was going to shut his mouth, he was so surprised! He has an excellent teacher and the discipline really was something! Never saw such a quiet, well disciplined happy bunch, since the kids started school. Visited Richard's room and Rodney's too, but there was so much confusion in them that I didn't stay long. Maybe it's just the age groups that make the difference. I believe that the older these boys of ours get, the harder of hearing they get, so maybe it's the same at school. The teachers all speak highly of the kids, but don't know if that means anything or if they just tell all the parents that to keep them happy! Sounds good, anyway! Sure was good to say hello to you people! The next day, Dougie said, \"Let's call Grandpa and sing Happy Birthday to him again!\" They really got a kick out of that and Dougie can't understand why we can't do it again everyday! He's a character! He climbed up on my lap last week. I said, \"Whose little boy are you?\" He said, \"Mommy's\" and I said, \"And Daddy's?\" He looked at me and said, \"I don't got no Daddy.\" Mutt was sitting right beside me and I pointed to him and said, \"Well, who is that fellow then?\" Dougie looked at his Daddy, then threw his head back and laughed and said, \"Oh, mommy, that's a joke!\" Guess you know father was pretty surprised, but couldn't keep a straight face, so now he's the joker around here! Gotta go get my shovel and start digging mud off clean waxed floors. Grrrrrrrrrrrr. I'll chat with you again one of these days! \n",

      "Don't know where to start with this as so much has happened since I wrote last. Remember me writing about Lena Quinn, our commanding officer's wife who lived a block down the street and had 4 boys and a girl, the youngest twins the age of Dougie (only they had a boy and girl)? Well, Mutt had gone to Albuquerqueerque the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and about 8:30 pm that night Mrs. Cowart (a nurse) called me and we gabbed about ten minutes. I put the kids to bed and just crawled into my pajamas and the phone rang. It was a neighbor halfway between here and Lena's and she asked me what had happened at Quinn's because the ambulance was there. I jumped into my clothes (this was about 9:00 pm), left Karen with the kids and ran down there. Dr. McDowell and the priest were with Lena and the ambulance had already taken Major Quinn out of the house. He had died of a massive gastro-intestinal hemorrhage (the autopsy showed). Tommy, the 7 year old had gone back to the back bathroom and couldn't get the door open and came in and said he couldn't get Daddy's bathroom door open and Lena didn't give it much thought because it wasn't unusual for Major Quinn to lock the bathroom door. A few minutes later Bobby (the 12 year old) went back there and called his Dad to tell him something and came back and said, \"Momma, Dad doesn't answer me.\" Lena went back there and when she didn't get an answer, she took the bathroom key and opened the door. He was slumped over on the floor and already blue and Bobby helped her pull him out of the bathroom and the little ones were all standing there looking at him. She ran to the phone to call me and my line was busy (it was while I was talking to Mrs. Cowart), called Dr. McDowell and his line was busy, called Dr. Gay and he was in surgery, so called the police and they got the fire department with a resuscitator, but there wasn't anything they could do. They got Dr. McDowell in just a few minutes and he was there in no time flat, but it was too late. It made me sick! He was only 38 years old and they were to leave tomorrow to be transferred back to Boston, where both her family and his lived. I took the kids up here Wednesday morning (Bobby stayed with Lena and some of the other squadron wives and neighbors stayed round the clock with her) and they (the kids) stayed all day and were here Thursday, Friday, and Saturday too. Had Mrs. Cowart's two boys too because it was Thanksgiving vacation and everybody home from school, so I had 11 kids Wednesday and then Thanksgiving Day the Pugo's came for dinner with their daughter because we had planned our Thanksgiving dinner together earlier, so there were 11 kids and 4 adults Thanksgiving Day. I had the kids again Friday morning and one the neighbors took them while Mutt and I went out to the radar site for Memorial services for Major Quinn. After the short service in the building, we went outside an stood quietly till four jet bombers flew over in formation and then a few minutes later three of the four flew back over with the lead plane gone, indicating that the leader was missing. Lena and I had so much in common, 5 children (4 boys and 1 girl each), a set of twins each, husbands the same age, and both men with 17 years service each, and I couldn't help but think \"There, but by the grace of God, go I.\" I scarcely go to talk to her at all before she left because I was the only one her kids knew and figured I could help her most by taking care of the kids while she took care of other things that had to be done. Her kids are real good little rascals and I have never had a child other than my own that loved me like the little twin boy (Ralphie) did. He had red curly hair and freckles and blue eyes and would run to me the minute he saw me and hold up his arms and say \"Let me hold you!\" When they went to leave Saturday at 4:00 pm and they started to put him in Captain Burns's car to go to the airport in El Paso, little Ralph pulled away from them and ran over to me and said, \"No, no, I want to go to the Joneses' car\" and was crying like his heart would break. I loved him tight and told him we'd go in Joneses' car another time and he was still crying when they drove off. Poor little rascals and Christmas just around the corner! Lena is a wonderful person (a teacher) and I really miss her already. They had an airman from the radar site tow her car back to Massachusetts and heard yesterday that he'd had an accident somewhere in Indiana or Illinois and the car was completely demolished! All the kids clothes were in footlockers in the car too, but don't know if they were gone too or not. Never rains but what it pours! Last week was my week to work, so that's why I didn't get a letter off to you last week. Mutt left yesterday (Saturday) for Kansas City, Missouri and should be back Friday or Saturday. He went to some conference out there. Bet he's going to notice the change in thermometer readings back that-a-way! This is going to be a wild week. Haven't done my Christmas shopping yet and should get my packages off this week, because there isn't a minute to spare the week I work. Haven't started my Christmas cards yet either. Next Saturday is our Christmas party at the radar site for all the kids. Don't know when the school program is and the Sunday school program is the next Saturday, and this house has dust an inch thick, and ironing a mile high! Just don't know where to start! Almost forgot to tell you that Dougie got his bear and has he had a time with it! Can't drink milk at all now unless the bear drinks at the same time! Keeps the rest of us busy winding the winder to keep him going till Dougie can get the milk down. The little animals are all in bed except Karen and she's in the shower, so guess I'd best get to bed too because Mrs. Cowart and her two will be here at 7:30 am and time flies pretty fast between bedtime and getting-up time. Hope you have a Merry, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \n",

      "Happy New Year! Boy, I'm really on the ball! Gonna get one thank you letter off before the New Year gets here, I keep telling myself. Have been at the kids to write their thank-you letters, but haven't had much luck. Richard has written his twice and Dougie wrote right over the top of it, so Richard won't let me send it. Your Christmas box really created excitement as usual. Don't know which one of us kids enjoy it most! When we tore the paper off the box and Richard saw it was a beer box he said, \"Ohhh, somebody's been drinking beer!\" I said, \"Probably Grandma\" and he looked at me like he believed it, but it didn't take long for the rest of them to tell him that \"Grandma didn't either drink that beer. She just got the box from a beer store!\" The kids had their Sunday school Christmas program Christmas Eve, so we all went to that, but while the kids were in getting lined up for the program, Mutt drove home and got 4 bicycles and a tricycle out of the house next door (where we'd stored them) and put them in the living room, and then came right back for the program. You should have seen those kids' faces! They had looked at the price of them in the catalogs so just knew that was one thing they wouldn't get for Christmas. When they could catch their breath again and got calmed down a little we opened the rest of the packages. The boats went right into the kitchen sink and the next thing we knew, all three boys had their boats in the bathtub with white shirt sleeves and cuff buttons and all and Sunday trouser knees on the floor! I could have skinned them because the junior choir was singing Christmas Day at 9:30 am and they only have one white shirt apiece (the twins, that is! Mark is flush with shirts since he inherits two at a time), but it was Christmas, so they went to church in their new bright flannel shirts and I'm sure they sang just as well in colored shirts. I got an Armour pre-stuffed turkey, so just popped that in the oven and then we all went to church. Poor Dougie just about didn't make it through the services. It seems the boys and Karen were up and down all night looking to see if it was daylight yet so they could go ride their new bikes. Mutt woke up at 6:30 am and said, \"Want to get up and ride your bikes boys?\" He no more got the words out of the mouth than they were gone. Come to find out they were all dressed and just sitting on their beds waiting for the word go. We got bathrobes for the 3 boys, a sweater for Karen and cowboy pajamas for Doug with the money you sent, so they were all tickled pink. Mutt just sat there stunned when he saw the Masonic cuff links and tie clasp! Nothing could have pleased him more! You always know just the right thing to please people! The mixer cover is on the mixer, the toaster cover is on the toaster, the bread board with the kitchen prayer is on the wall in the kitchen, the plate you made mom, has served Christmas cookies to several batches of company. Haven't used the apron or the pin and cuff button set but am hostess for the wives club in January, so will show off my apron then. Karen has made her belt and worn it with everything but her pajamas I think! She wore her \"diamond\" bracelet to church Christmas Day. Dougie's duck has been chasing the butterfly like mad, but still hasn't caught it. Had a letter from Lena Quinn. She's at her father's house and is looking for another house to move her family in as soon as she can. The two older boys are back in school and the older boy is on a basketball team so is kept busy, which is good. Tomorrow is my day to go back to work again. Get Wednesday afternoon, all day Thursday, Saturday afternoon, and Sunday off, so will scarcely earn any of my check this week, but won't offer it back to them! Ha! Mutt just took the Christmas tree down and the boys are out planting it on the empty lot next door. They're going to water it, so it will grow too, but they'll leave enough room for the Drege-Fay-Monger-Jelleberg-Krohn bus to park there next Christmas. We did miss you at Christmas, but knew it's a long cold trip and wouldn't fancy making that trip at this time of year myself. Well, I'd better go take the clothes in before they get damp again. (My Sunday sin - lines full of clean clothes!) By the way, I took that cookbook to bed with me the other night to read and darned near fell out of bed when I came to Betty's Spaghetti Recipe. Some of those casseroles sound wonderful and plan to try them one of these days. Gotta go or get fired! Have a Happy New Year and we'll be thinking about you! Thanks again for all the wonderful Christmas presents! They were really tops, as usual. \n",

      "Sure I just wrote to Fritzie and Bruce yesterday, and I'm writing to you today! Crazy?? Oh, maybe just a little, but not too noticeable. I hope! Mutt came home from work last night and I noticed him changing bars on his uniforms, but figured he was just changing uniforms, and guess he finally gave up on my noticing anything, because he finally pinned and put his cap right in front of my nose and said, \"Now, do you see anything different?\" Felt like 2 cents waiting for change!! Nothing like have a great observant wife! When he quit smoking a couple years ago he waited three days for me to notice that he'd quit smoking and he finally told me! He just didn't know that I didn't wash ashtrays every day!! Don't know how much of a raise he will get, but it should be around $30.00. That will help Santa Claus pay off his bicycles a little faster, too. Are you spoiling that Lori Fay?? I'd sure like to help you! We get some of the cutest babies in the office at work and some such pathetic ones. I work for Dr. Basile in the mornings (she's a Pediatrician) and for her husband, Dr. Gay in the P.M's, he's a surgeon. Dr. Basile is the only Pediatrician in town, so gets all the cerebral palsy patients and other cripples, but sure has a bunch of darling well babies, too. I really enjoy them. Just took time off to put Dougie and Bobby to bed. They've been pretty good little stinkers this morning. Karen was sick with a headache again last night and spent the night heaving, but is fine this morning. Guess I'd better get her hair thinned and cut again. She likes her hair long because one of the little boys in school told her she was pretty one day and since then she wants her hair left long. Think I convinced her this morning that she'd be just as pretty if I got her hair thinned real good and just the ends trimmed. When I had her hair cut short in Japan she never had a headache for months, but then no little boy had told her that she was pretty!! They have school dances here for the sixth graders and I've never been there to watch them \"hop\", but one of the mothers that had a son at the last one, said she was never so thoroughly entertained in her life as she had been just watching those kids dance, so I intend to go to their Valentine's dance. They need so many parent volunteers for chaperones anyway so maybe we can both go. Karen said her hair had to be long till after the dance! Them kids! Did you ever have any problems with your children? Ha! I know you didn't because you raised us right, right off the floor sometimes with a hot pancake turner if I recall!! Never will forget how mad that made me. Didn't hurt where I was hit! Just my dignity was hurt. Makes me wonder what things these kids will remember!! The mailman is due by here in a few minutes, so better get this in the mailbox. Enjoy yourselves out there with those little and love them all for me! We'll let you know soon as we hear what they're going to do with us. Might be a couple months till we get the axe, but we'll make our summer plans according to which way we go from here. The boys are ready to go to the Drege farm any day! They never have mentioned the \"education\" they got out there and thought sure Mark would have told all the neighbor kids how they take temperatures on the cows up there! Egad!! It's a good thing he will be at Cub Scouts tomorrow after school while I have the Girl Scouts here because they're supposed to learn how to take temperatures and read a thermometer and I'm sure Mark could add spice to the meeting if he was here! Gotta get the mop bucket out and get at this place. There's not one clean floor in the place. Plenty of wax on all except the kitchen and the boys bedroom so the rest just gets the mop this week!! Have a real good vacation and be good!! \n",

      "Have Dougie and Bobbie up at the table eating peanut butter sandwiches so I'll scratch off a few lines while I watch them eat. They're both ready for naps and they get a little goofy at this time a day so if I don't \"watch\" them eat they're up to all sorts of foolishness. Well, we're still waiting to hear if we're going to be moved or not. Wish they'd either say yea or nay instead of letting us sit in suspense. This is my week off, so I've been vacationing. Washed clothes all day yesterday and got the living room den and kitchen scrubbed and waxed and the front half of the house looks pretty fair. Stripped the beds this morning so have clean sheets and pillow cases to put back on. Sure glad I got them out early, because the sand is coming again, and got all the sheets out and dry before the sand got here. This is sand storm season, so if you don't get your wash dry by 3 o'clock, at least, you have it all to wash over again. How was your trip? Was it cold out there? By the reports in the Tribune you must have missed some pretty cold weather up there in North Dakota while you were gone, didn't you?? Dougie discovered that all he had on his bed was his mattress and just said, \"Why, Mother, I fot you were gonna put clean sheets on my bed!\", so guess I'd better stop long enough to get him bedded down. He got himself undressed and washed his face and hands (and got them clean, too) so guess I'd better help him make his bed. Shoot!! He's 3 1/2 years old! Oughta be able to make his own bed. Don't have a bit of news from this end of the line. I owe everyone letters again so don't have news from anyone. One o'these days I'll catch up. Ha!! Been saying that for years and about the time I think I'm getting there, we move and I start all over. Our next move should be our last, though, because we'll be so near the 20 year mark then. May 19th, 1961 is Mutt's 20 year mark. He will ahve almost 21 years actual credit, though, because they'll add on his reserve and national guard time after 20 years is completed. Sayyyy, you have a birthday coming up in about 10 days, don't you, now, in case I don't get another letter off to you before then, soooo Happy Birthday, Mom, and many, many more to come!! The squadron is having a pot luck supper the night of your birthday, so we'll celebrate your birthday for you. Don't have any idea what I'll take. We have our monthly wives meeting the 13th, so think I'll just listen in and see what everyone else is bringing and then decide. Would like to take some banana bread, but some of these gals have some queer ideas on what \"pot luck\" is! Karen joined 4-H yesterday and is really thrilled over it since Sandy Digge told her all about it! The Girl Scout troop she's in, is about to fold up, anyway. Hesitated to let her join since we might be leaving, but knew she'd feel real hurt if it ended up we stayed here and I'd said, \"no\", and believe she will get a lot more out of her 4-H, than she seems to be getting out of Girl Scouts. The woman that is in charge of her Girl Scout troop has no interest in it and is one of these women that starts everything and then drops it as soon as she gets the kids all enthused. She was the one that started the Children's Choir and then dropped that, too. Now she's started helping on a PTA Committee so she ought to be good for a month or so that that! I take the Girl Scouts here the week I don't work, so she only has them every other week. They should get their \"Home Nurse\" badge after our next meeting. Well, I'd better put this out on the mailbox and get on the move. The herd will start marching in here any minute now!\n",

      "Started to write earlier this P.M., but \"ol' widder Painter\" came over to see \"ol' widder Jones\" and by the time she left it was time to fix supper. Mutt came home this weekend and C-47 was down in K.C. to pick up repairs and it picked up 20 of the men that were down there at school, and they got in here at 11 P.M. Fri night. Dorothy Painter and I went out to pick up our husbands and I just about didn't recognize mine. He looked terrible and was so sick he could scarce stand up. It seems he'd had a migraine since last Sunday and wouldn't go to sick call for fear he'd miss 3 days of school, and if he misses 3 days, he's out this class automatically and will have to go back to the Sept. and October class, so he wouldn't check in at sick call. I called the Grand Fork clinic Saturday morning and took him down there and the Dr. gave him some pills for the pain and some pills to take 4 times a day to keep him calm, cool, and collected, but he still had his headache when he left here this morning at 9. He was some better yesterday afternoon, but only slept from about midnight till 3 or 4 am and was up walking around the rest of the night again. His blood pressure is up to 160+ again, but with no sleep for a week, it's not surprising. He promised he'd go to sick call down there Mon. or Tues. if these pills didn't help him. He drove the car back, but a Sgt. from here went back with him, so at least he wasn't driving alone. Dorothy Painter just told me this afternoon that Capt. Painter said Mutt had been up walking the halls every night for the past week, but he hadn't told a soul he was sick for fear he'd miss those 3 days. I have Painter keeping an eye on him more. Mutt had class from noon to 6 P.M. one day and then has 10-14 pages of notes, codes, figures etc. to memorize and be able to go to work on the computers at noon the next day and work till 6 P.M. on the computers. Then the next day it's class again and the following day more computers. Of course, he's apt to be out more than three days. Capt. Burns had told us it was really a rough course, and that he was sure glad he had it behind him, so now we're finding out what he meant. Mutt won't be home next weekend (that's why he came home this weekend) because he has another exam on the computers next Thurs., Fri., and Saturday. He's going to try to get down to Laurette the weekend of the 22nd, and should be back here the 28th around midnight or thereabouts. Needless to say, we won'tn be home till he gets back now. He's lost 15# since he went down there, too, which didn't hurt him any, but wish he'd go to sick call and that they'd give him something so he could sleep a night or two and I'm sure that's his trouble. If he doesn't call me tomorrow night, I'm going to call him to see how he is. Looked for Pat and Don to day, but guess they didn't go to Winnipeg like they thought they were going to. Their kids sure were good here! Found a pr. of Mike's training pants and his stuffed kitten, but haven't found anything of Donita's so guess she got everything of hers all gathered up. She's so old for her little years and was more like a mother to Mike than a sister. Course that Mike kid I'd take in a minute!!! He is the cutest thing we've had around here in a long time. Committed my Sunday sin and put 40 ears of corn in the freezer this morning. Hope it will be good, because we all like corn on the cob. Have bags of peaches resting down the basement waiting for me, too, so that's my project for tomorrow. Have to go downtown with Dorothy Painter sometime tomorrow a get a couple gifts since we have Birthdays Friday. Mark is just dying to give that pkg. (in our closet) to give Dougie, but so far hasn't spilled the beans. Well, I hear Doug and Mark playing in the bathtub, so better go supervise before they flood the place. I scrubbed, waxed and vacuumed the house from top to bottom Friday, so heaven help them if they mess up the bathroom. Come and see us sometime when you can stay a while. We sure enjoy having yo here!! We'll be home whenever we can. Sure is nice to be close enough that we can even come home on weekends during school months if we decide to. Oh, Lordy, Richard is up \"helping\" Mark and Doug!!! Grrrrrrrr - here comes the old bear herself, so they better get dry fast!! P.S. All dry and in bed!! Guess they heard me coming! Ha!\n",

      "Just finished the supper and breakfast dishes, so will write a few lines while Johnnie Burns and Doug are up at the table playing with clay. Better I stay close at hand and supervise, anyway, so they don't try to eat it. How did your Blood Sugar report come out, Mom? Thnak you so much for letting us know about Grandpa Jelleberg. Needless to say, we sure were shocked! I got a letter off to Sadie and Everett right away. This has been a busy week. Mutt works different hours every day, so it's a rat race trying to figure out which day we have a big meal at noon and which day we have it at supper time! He doesn't know two days ahead, what hours he will be working. Monday, it was 4P.M. to midnight, Tuesday it was 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., today it was 7:30A.M. -5:30P.M. and tomorrow, he works 4P.m. to midnight, but doesn't know yet what he will work on Friday. Really gets confusing. Monday morning I had the three little Swangler boys here while they went to George's uncle's funeral. Fay got back about 11 to pick her kids up, then Karen came home for lunch at noon and the boys at 12:15 and Mutt had to have his uniform and shirt pressed and he left about 2:45 P.M., and my 10 Cub Scouts started filing in about 3:30. Sure was a busy day! Yesterday was almost as bad. That was our \"tour of base housing\" day, so I packed lunches for the boys and they ate at school. Karen came home and ate her lunch here, Pa left at 9:30 for the base, Doug went to the Swangers and Alyce Burns, Dorothy Painter and I went out to the base. They took us through two units, but neither one of them were the 4 bedrooms like we'll have someday, (next spring, they think now) so didn't learn much. Did see that they have long narrow windows in the base housing where they're shorter and wider here, so reckon we'll all have fun with curtains again. The housing is going to be nice, though, someday. The roads are sure a mess out there right now, though. I have a load of wash ready to hang out, so suppose I'd better get busy or they'll never get dry. Looks like a good drying day. We had a Cub Scout pack meeting last night. Really get a kick out of the skits they put on. Our den has the skit next month (November 23rd) and the theme is \"Country Store\" so will have to get buy and figure out something for that. Could we borrow the old phonograph and a record or two?? That is, if you come to see us before the or if we get down there before the 23rd. Lordy, don't mail it. they suggested that the parents dress in old time clothes, but that didn't go over too well, since there are so many that just don't have anything of that sort at all, so they just left it \"optional.\" Mutt just called me from the base. He finally went to the Dr. with his aching knee and they put him on crutches! He twisted it one day (about 3 or 4 weeks ago) playing football with the kids out here and it had bee hurting, but he just wouldn't report in about it, till I noticed it was swelling and \"crackled\" when he walked so he got tired of my nagging and went in this morning. Dr. said he has \"Burnati's\" of the knee joint and gave him pills to dry up the fluid and put an elastic bandage on it, gave him the crutches and orders to stay off the foot. Now we'll see how well he minds!! Don't have any place to go to-night and no deadlines to meet except \"lunch\" today, so it's a peaceful day. Tomorrow night is \"has class\" again. Still haven't finished my first hat, but should finish that tomorrow night. Sure would like to have the Pheasant feathers for the following week, but don't worry about it if there's no way to get there here by then. Don't like to ask you to mail things because it's darned cold these days and the post office isn't exactly next door!! Just bring 'em when you come to see us! Dougie just left in a huff and he's going to see Grandma and Grandpa and he's not coming back for a year and he's taking all his new cars with him too. So there, too!! His mother wouldn't give him a cupcake before lunch and he just didn't want an old cracker! Poor child!! Running out of room on this ol' paper.\n",

      "Got Daddy's hat wrapped and Momma's newspaper wrapped and Mutt is on his way to the post office to get it mailed.  Am a little worried for fear that hat is going to be too big!  The clerk told me the extra long oval is the same as long oval and if he's sold me a bill of sales, I'll shoot him!!  Looked for you when you come back from St. Paul, Daddy, but didn't hear the doorbell or see your smiling face at the window in the door, so that's why you don't have your hat now.  Figured you were probably in a rush to get back since Uncle Elmer was so sick.  We've talked and talked trying to figure out some way to come home Tuesday, but it doesn't look at all promising.  Mutt is going to work 7:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. next week, which means I'll have to find a baby sitter for Dougie for Monday and Thursday since I've already promised to work those two days.  Monday, 10:45 AM.  Too many interruptions so I quit on this Saturday.  Didn't go to work today since the only sitters I could find were clear on the other side of town and the city streets are like glass.  Called the hospital yesterday forenoon and they said I could come in any time I want to, so I will work 7-3 on Saturday and maybe a couple evenings from 5:30 PM to midnight.  Wish they'd hurry up and start moving people into base housing.  This place is too rich for our blood, but everything else is just as high, so no use trying to move.  Got a notice with our last water bill and it's going up from $.12 per 1000 to $.22 per thousand, these apartments were sold to a Leo Mandry last month and rumors are flying that he is going to raise the rent to $140.00 or $150.00, but so far we haven't had any notice to that effect, so we're holding our breath.  We had estimated at $180.00 a month this winter, but it will be closer to $200.00, if the rent doesn't go up.  If the rent goes up, they might as well go out to the base with the men on payday and collect their checks as they're handed out.  Meowww!! Getting \"catty\" in my old age, aren't I??  We get by alright, but every day you hear of some enlisted man who has had to send his family home where rent is cheaper because his landlord has jumped the rent $25.00 or more since they moved in and they simply don't make enough money to pay over $100.00 plus utilities for 2 bedrooms.  Went to PTA at the boy's school on Monday and Karen's school on Tuesday.  Didn't know till Tuesday night that Karen is what they call their \"power\" class.  They're all top grade students in that class with no slow learners, and they push them extra hard because they think can handle it and they're testing their capacity.  Their Math teacher said this class is 6 weeks ahead of the other 7th grade classes in school and that they will be well into 8th grade work before school is out this term.  She really has the homework and I'd wondered why, but guest that explained it.  They said, too, that it makes them work just a little harder when they have all quick learners in one class because the competition is greater.  She came home with all A's and B's so guess she is doing alright.  Rodney and Richard got all A's and B's (Rodney 7 A's and 5 B's, Richard 8 A's and 4 B's) and Mark got all B's and C's except an A, in Physical Ed!  He sure was proud of that A!  He seems to be coming along pretty well with his reading now, though, so hope he continues to improve.  Feel that if he could master that he'd have it hipped.  Margaret Trayer Ruced called me yesterday afternoon.  They were at Bob's folks for coffee en route from Fargo to Rugby.  She called to see if I'd make her a hat!!  Lordy, have I been killed over that hat making! Met people at both PTA's that I never knew before and they'd say, \"Saw your picture in the paper.\"  Egads!! Of course Mutt Jones has just about had it here!  Every time he picks up something with a button off it or a jacket with the sleeve lining ripped or anything that needs mending (which there's always plenty of) he holds it up and addresses the air and says, \"But my wife has a background in sewing and makes lovely hats!!\"  He's not long for this world if he doesn't watch his step, the crazy Irishman!!  One of the officers that rides in he same car pool as Mutt does (Captain Weaver) told Mutt to ask me if I'd autograph the cuff of his shirt!  He's just lucky he said it in the care!  If he'd dare come to the door, I'd have slugged him!!  Hear no noise from the basement, so I guess my washer is off.  Better go starch 'em and hang 'em,  Pa's about due for clean uniform shirts so better get 'em strung up down there.  Sure is a nasty day in this neck of the woods.  It's blowing dirt and snow together and sure is a mess.  Have the kids eat at school now and they're really glad since it has gotten so cold.  We won't be coming home for Uncle Elmer's funeral.  Feel bad that we can't make it, but with the weather the way it is, don't feel we should risk it.  Mutt couldn't get off and I'd have to take the kids out of school and drive it myself and I don't like these slick roads.  Really do appreciated you letting us know, though, even if we can't come home.  Felt terrible after I'd written you and asked you to come on Tuesday instead of the weekend and then got your letter saying Daddy was going to St. Paul and you were going to come down and stay till he came back.  Then after I read in the Tribune that he'd gone to St. Paul and didn't stop on his way back, I was afraid I'd made you think we were too busy to see you and I was just sick!  Hope it was Uncle Elmer that kept you from stopping, Daddy, because you know we're tickled to death to see you anytime.  Sure hope I didn't give you the wrong impression.  You just don't know what a moral booster you two are, so please come and see us anytime!!  There's nothing so important that we can't find time to enjoy you, you know!  Greet the Emerson's for us.  It's been years and years since I saw Kenneth and Buster and Harry, but can't figure any way to get there and back that same day.\n",

      "Well, we didn't make it, did we? Mutt got back here Tuesday night or rather Wednesday morning at 1:45 A.M. The Dr. At the eye clinic didn't want to operate on him right now as he didn't think it was necessary, so Mutt talked him into letting him come back on the train. The train that was due in Minot at 11:30 A.M. didn't get in Minot till 8:30 P.M.,so it worked out real nice for him. He was supposed to wait till Monday for the military air evac plane, but talked pretty fast, since he couldn't see sitting there almost a week for nothing. Then the darned heater went out of commission and couldn't get the temp above 37 degrees in the car and back near the rear window, they couldn't get the temp up about 23 degrees, so didn't dare start out with the kids. Then, too, he called out at the base trying to find out if they were going to walk today and the Major was going to work today. Called the highway dept. Wednesday nite and they said they were expecting winds up to 20 or 30 mph during the night, so we decided not to try to travel after dark with no heater and with the wind forecast, so stayed home. Sure did think about you all yesterday, though! It was a real pretty day here, too, and I could even smell the turkey, I believe!! It's quite here this morning. Mutt's gone to work and Doug is the only one up and he's sitting here asking me if I can hear him sleeping!! Can you?? Our Cub Scout skit went over with a bang and the boys went through it like a breeze! Really was proud of them! Now we start on Christmas gifts and decorations and this I really enjoy! Our Country Store was so good, the Cub master asked us to save it till February so they can put it on display downtown when they have Scout displays in the store windows! I tell you we're having more fun!! Today I plan to wax floors from upstairs to downstairs, so now I'll see how far I get. Somehow my plans get disrupted every so often and I don't accomplish what I plan to. That ever happen to you? The kids are really getting excited over Christmas! We're coming home if we have to crawl on hands and knees, I keep telling myself. Had a headache all day yesterday and don't know if it was really sinuses or if I was feeling sorry for myself for not getting home for Thanksgiving when we were this close. Some more drugs and APC got my head opened up and draining good, so maybe it was my imagination after all. I've about giving up working! By the time I pay a baby-sitter and income tax and social security and they dock a half hour for lunch, I don't clean enough to make it worth the effort. I get so far behind here on working and mending, too, that it's hopeless, as I haven't signed up for any more days. Was so glad your had fit, Daddy! That had me worried, especially since you needed it for Uncle Elmers funeral. I'll bet Aunt Mamie will be lost in Mpls. Poor soul! She may have been an ornery one in her day, but can't help felling sorry for her, when she has to be uprooted from all the people she has known for years and spend her last time almost completely with strangers. Seems worse, with Christmas around the corner, too. I don't even have Irene's address, but would like to have it. Base housing has been help up again and we've been booted back down the line. Don't even have a house number out there now. This stinkin' Col. Lous (Base C.O.) is doling out housing according to hs desires and is issuing the first housing to only Captains and Majors and Colonels and his own personal friends! Talk about a stink, it really is one! That meas that Captains with 6 years service will get housing before any lower ranking men like Mutt with 18-20 years service. This is not the Air Force policy and he's in for trouble when he gets the first batch on base if he pulls it this way. He's held all the letters (written orders assigning you a house number and date so you can give the landlord 30 days notice) now and no one is moving till January since he decided it would be a hardship for people to move during the Christmas holiday!! Hardships my foot, when you could avoid paying rent and utilities sky high! What he should have said was that the Colonels didn't want to move because they can pay these rents and survive because their rental allows a nice more than pay for it! I tell you, this is a hot, hot sand feet around here. The Air Force policy on housing is to issue so many unite to Col., Maj., Capt., Lt., 2nd Lt. That is, so many to each rank. (CWO's rank with Lt's.) Then if there are, say 6 units for Capt's first and those with 6 or 7 years wait their turn. When they've served their 17-18 years service and up, they get their priority, as they've earned it the same as the others, but this C.O. out here is strictly a party man and believes rank is really rank here. Then, too, if you're a sot you rank just that much higher with him! Oh, I tell you I can sure gripe these days. Here is Mark Hamilton looking for breakfast so spare the rest will follow soon. I hear a lot of chatter up there, so they must be alive up there. Haven't done on item of Christmas shopping yet and here December is creeping up on us next week. Did buy Christmas Cards, oh, yes, I did buy the gifts for the names we drew, so I have done some shopping! Sayyy I'm not too far behind then, am I? The kids are really enjoying the snow! They think shoveling walks and sidewalks is fun and they have a couple \"igloos\" started in the backyard and Dougie gets out there and shovels right along with the rest of them. Went to make felt Christmas stockings for the kids this year, since they've never had them so think I'll let them help me, if I can get the felt today. By the way, Mom, I haven't found any more of those stuffed toy patterns you showed me, but will keep looking. Well, here's \"wah wee wah way\" (as he used to hall himself) looking for breakfast. It's 9 A.M., too, and guess it's time for me to get on the beam here! Time sure flies! Know you had a real good day yesterday and we were thinking about you! Come and see u! Since I'm retired (again) I'll be home!\n",

      "Dougie and I are watching Captain Kangaroo, so it is a good time to talk to you a minute. Time flies by so fast. I worked from 6 to 12 P.M. last night, and I am always slower getting started the next morning. I just work Thursday and Friday night and it is much better working these hours than the day shift. Not so much confusion. I am the only RN on after 6 P.M (on 3rd South) but have two aids with me. There are 24 patients which is a handful, since about 20 are 65 or over and several have fractured hips or legs and need special care to keep bedsores away. I like to take care of babies and older patients, anyway, so do enjoy it. They called yesterday to see if I would not work weekends every once in awhile but I said \"mix\". Do not want to give up my scouts and cannot do everything and do a decent job, so \"part time\" hospital work will have to be limited. By the way, Daddy, this is science month in Cub scouts, and since your outdoor thermometer is not real accurate, will send you one that the scouts made last week. This is real accurate and guaranteed to work!! You should have heard the chuckles when they working on them!! Well, do you have that latest granddaughter spoiled yet?? Gee, I would like to see her! She sure is the topic of conversation around here! She probably will not get home till spring now. She should really be cute by then, and all rounded out and getting personality! Housing situation remains about the same. We are in with the Captains now (latest report, anyway) but we are one of the very few entitled to 4 bedrooms, so will likely be in the next bunch of officers in, but when that will be, heaven only knows. The first bunch is supposed to start moving in Monday. Fails move Thursday, and Burnses on Friday, so guess they are really going to open up out there. The next batch to be opened is 36 quarters for enlisted men, so we won't be in that bunch and they don't have their \"letters\", yet, and those come 30 days before move in, but they are supposed to be out by February 1st which means move in by March 1st for that bunch of enlisted men. This latest info Mutt got from Colonel Meusser, who is housing officer, so it should be accurate. Ella Fedje called, all expected when the Tribune came out announcing the Drege daughter. She was so excited, you would have thought it was her granddaughter, and was so relieved to know that Helen and the baby were both okay. Had a letter from Nordia Padall Johnson yesterday, saying they were waiting for Harriet Bekken to come in for delivery. I did not even know she was expecting. My, but I am behind the times! She had a birthday cake on the supper table last night! Dougie came out in the kitchen about noon yesterday and said, \"Do you know that Huckleberry Hound has never had a birthday cake?\" Sasoo we baked a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting (Huckleberry's favorite, I am told) and there was one candle on it (he is month old, you know) and out of the alphabet cereal box we got the letters to put \"Huckleberry Hound Dog\" on the cake. The kids sang \"Happy Birthday, Huckleberry\", and now we can eat the cake! That hound is the most popular thing we have ever had around here. Dougie is invited out to dinner tomorrow. Johnnie Burns is having six friends to dinner because he is afraid there will not be any little boys out at the base and he thinks he will be lonesome! How is your sugar behaving, mom?? Are you eating the sweets for her, Daddy? When are you coming to see us? We have not seen you for about 3 weeks and that is a long time, you know. I will tell you what!! You tuck Jane Marie under your coat, and bring her along! Do not imagine Sandra would miss her, would she?? Gotta get to work. Have mountains of wash and ironing all the time, it seems. One thing about it, though, it always waits for me. By the way, mom, did you go down and buy that washer and dryer, yet??? Still think you need it, after my experience of wrestling tubs and sheets in that lonely cellar hole!!! It did not hurt me any, but cannot see, the sense of your doing it when you could have it a little easier, you know! Dougie is giving me a bad time here. He says, \"mother, all you have been doing today is writing to grandma and grandpa! I bet they are getting tired! Maybe you are! Do not spoil that baby girl so much that I will not have a chance when I get there!!\n",

      "Just wanted to say good morning to you and also to send this clipping off out of the paper before it got lost. There are seven dens in this pack and you'll notice there were 43 arrowpoints awarded and 14 of those were from our den, so our boys shone like diamonds! We are going to make relief maps of North Dakota today. We are going to try to come home next weekend so be prepared, Daddy, with your life history! We are going to try to come home this past weekend but yours truly had that flu bug that Karen had, and I didn't dare get that many miles away from the bathroom. Richard started yesterday, so he has a monopoly on the basement bathroom and I hold the monopoly on the upstairs bathroom, and everyone moves when they see us coming. We can't come home while there's any chance of any of us having flu, because we have to be clean and clear enough to get near that baby. I think Karen is dying by degrees to see that baby gir!!I might as well give up on this! The phone has rang five times since I started this letter and now it's 11 o'clock so better get moving if Doug and I are going to have lunch and get the dinner and breakfast dishes done and then I have to get nine maps of North Dakota drawn out and salt and flour ready to moisten when the Cubs get here. We are having a pinewood derby this month at the pack meeting, too, so each boy is making a race car out of blocks of pinewood and then we have a run off in the den and the best one goes to the pack meeting. Hope to see you this weekend if everyone is over the bug. At least, we don't have any vomiting with it, but never saw food travel through so fast! Kinda knocks the zip out of you, though, after a few days of such high power digestion. Got to get busy!\n",

      "It's 9.30A.M. and Doug has just gone up to get dressed and I am still in my pajamas. Reckon I will get fired?? If they fire me here, I will just \"go home to mother\" so look out!!. This has been a wild week, scouts on Monday, blue and gold banquet Tuesday night, nothing Wednesday, I worked last night, and of course go in to night, too. I had the flu Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday but got er whipped now. They had a \"test mission\" at the base yesterday, so Mutt was up at 4 A.M. and of course stayed up to some and get me at 1:15 A.M. So he had a long day. He was up again at 5:30 again this morning. That man floors me! He gets up in good spirits 99 mornings out of 100 regardless of how much sleep he has gotten, and if I don't get my sleep, I am a pure devil to get up in the morning!! Dougie got up with his Daddy this morning and \"they had bacon and eggs before the rest of us got up. Dougie thought he had really cut the mustard!! Cora Dergie got a letter from Major Dargie in Glasgow and they are leaving here the 7th of March, and are going right in to base housing, so she is relieved. She brought over a letter that had come from a lawyer in Washington in regard to Jeff's representation of the government on those two law suits he was in Washington D.C., for and talk about a letter of commendation! It really was a credit to Major Dargis. Ms. Reel had sent it to Colonel Lewis (the CO that tried to fire Major Dargis) and there was no way for Colonel Lewis to ignore it, so he had to write a letter to enclose with the letter from Kelly (the lawyer) and send it on the Glasgow and his Colonel Lewis's letter was stapled on to Kelly's and I will bet Lewis chewed nails all the while he wrote it. Got a kick out of his statement in the letter, \"I have delayed forwarding this letter of commendation to you to put in Major Dargis' file, to give you ample opportunity to get Major Dargis settled in your squadron first.\" What he should have said was, \"I have held onto this darned commendation as long as I dare, and with no way out am forced to forward this to you.\", am so glad that someone backed that fellow down! He is the most disliked commander I have ever seen or heard of since we started this service life. We will meet his Waterloo one of these days, though. Our Blue and gold banquet, went over nicely. Mark did a beautiful job with his welcome! He was the only scout that had any part of the program and he got up there with all the poise of a professional! Guess there were about 150 people there and any number of them came over to me to tell me what a perfect job he had done. The scoutmaster's wife called me the next day, said her husband asked her to call to tell me that he had heard a lot of \"welcome\" but none as beautifully presented as Mark's. I told Mark and he has been walking on clouds ever since! She had two animal zoos on our table (animals made from everything!) and everyone was fascinated with that, too, so all in all, it was worth every minute of work it took! (Even the cooks from the Church circle that served the banquet came out to inspect the zoo!) Linda Burns spent Wednesday night with Karen since that was their last night of their girl scout First aid class, so they will get their certificates now. Now, Mr. John Fay, I am going to get you cornered one of these days and get your life history because March is \"Know your state\" month in Scouts and we are going to have something no other den has and that is the story of N. Dale's, youngest pioneer. Do you know the name of the newspaper that had that article about your birth in?? Wonder if Frank would let me know it to have a photostat made, must write and ask him soon. Do you have a picture of yourself, Mr Fay? We want that, too!! You will not come and see us, so we will have to come and see you, I guess, one of these weekends, but be thinking about this because you are in for the third degree!! Ha! She don't plan to come home this weekend, unless something spurs us on at the last minute. We never decide to go till we are in the car and on the road, though. Must get on the ball here. Dougie and I are thinking about going over to see Ella Fedje this morning, if I get dressed!! Come and see us anytime! I am dying to see Jane Marie!! Since Jeffie and Loren will not let you bring her with you, we will just have to go see her!! Be good, you two and we will see you one of these days! \n",

      "Whew!! Just got the last of the Mohicans out the door to school! This was one of those mornings. Started frying pancakes at 6:30 and fed Father first, then Richard and I ate, Mark and Rodney came along next, Doug strolled in next, and Karen arrived about 7:30 or later, but they all got their beds made, and the table cleared and I got the living room straightened and some clothes on the line and another load in the machine, so it wasn't a total loss. Thought I had them all gone and Rodney charged in the back door with \"Mother, I'm supposed to have some material for art class\", soooo got his material and sent some for Richard because he forgot to get his and believe they're gone for the last time today! Some days they leave once and other days I send them out 2 or 3 times each before they're finally gone. Thank you for all the fun we had this weekend! Must get started on reorganizing my manuscript on John Fay, too, after I finish this. I found that name of that patient we had that was from Blackduck, so figured I'd better put it in here right this morning or I'd forget it again. Her name was Mrs. Selma E. Gelstod and in parentheses was Slema Engstrand. Anybody you ever heard of?? Is it snowing at your house this morning? We got a little snow yesterday and it's starting again today. Will have to meet the boys at the door after school with the shovel. They'll love that! Dougie just informed me that if I didn't make him some jelly pretty soon he was going to write a letter to Grandma and she'd give him some jelly! Got the Sure-Jell Monday, so guess I'll bring up the sand cherry juice and make some today. People around here aren't going to rest till I get some jelly made. Jack Linkletter is on, showing tattoos and I just decided we should all hurry down to the nearest tattoo artist and get tattooed. Ssh! I think they're repulsive! Karen got her Girl Scout cookies Monday night and got all 24 boxes sold that night, so she's through with that. Most of the troops didn't get their cookies till Tuesday, so she got the jump on them and had them all sold in less than an hour. Mutt came home last night and said we're number 7 on the \"Sage\" housing list (not the base list). When they issue housing they give a few to each organization but there's no certain number to any unit each month, so it doesn't mean much except that we'll probably move about the 4th of July. Are you all recuperated over the wild weekend? Should have changed the sheets for you in that bed that Mark slept in, but didn't think of it till we were on the road. I'll do better next time! Gonna have to sign this off! Doug just brought me 2 packages of Sure-Jell and a box of Paraseal Wax and said, \"Do you want me to bring up the jar of juice, too?\" I can see him coming up the stairs with a half gallon of sand cherry juice and only getting halfway with it and dropping it on the cement floor! Ugh!! Guess I am gonna make jelly this morning, at any rate. Come and see us and thanks again for entertaining us and feeding us, and giving us needed history, etc etc etc. \n",

      "Say, I'm dressed, bed is made, teeth brushed, fresh lipstick on, hair combed!!!  Man and I am on the ball today!!  Got up yesterday morning feeling sooo good and feel just as good today, so believe I have it whipped now.  Got home fine Sunday, we had a blowout about a mile before we got to McCanna and the kids thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen!  Leave it to kids!  The hubcap went flying out in the ditch, but the car never left the road and the kids thought it was such fun to get out of the car and watch Daddy change the tire.  The tire was really chewed up, but the tread didn't even look worn, so don't know what caused the blowout.  Mutt took it to a Goodyear (?) dealer and they gave him $25.00 towards a new tire because the tread was too good and they figured it had to be a fault in the tire someplace, but it was chewed up too much to tell where the fault might have been.  We were real surprised the get the $25.00 credit because we didn't expect it or ask for it.  Still paid $28.00 but that's pretty cheap for a new tire when we expected it to be $45.00 or more.  Mark and Richard brought in some dirt and peat moss before school, so we planted several more packages of seeds, so we're going to plant some more.  Should know by next weekend whether or not will be moving on base this summer, so we're going to keep our flowers in milk cartons till we know where we're going to be.  We're going to have some flowers, anyway, wherever we be.  Though all the way home, Mom, about what a \"Mother's Day\" you had Mom!  The whole brunt of the dinner fell to you and you looked so tired the time you sat down to eat and I thought then, \"This is Mother's Day???\"  Next year will you have dinner with us??  Either that, or if we came home, so help me we'll figure some way for all us old fogeys to go out to dinner (and put the kids out to pasture) or else figure ahead where we all fix some of the essentials\" so you won't have it all!!  After all, that was supposed to be your day!!  Sure was glad Sadie and Everett bought that man of theirs down for all to see.  He sure is a beautiful baby.  Guess all babies around 10lbs must be beautiful babies!  Amen!!  Say, now, weren't that a good run??  Just dug out my Good Sam Hosp. letter and she that the reunion is June 26th so hope Fritz and Bruce don't pick that weekend to get there!!  Mutt has 19 days leave he has to take or else give them up because they can only carry 60 days leave and he had 86 or 88 or something like that just before he took this last week off, so he plans to try to go to California sometime the middle of June, too, so it will be a busy month.  If I come for the nurses reunion, I plan to leave the kids here with Father and come alone that weekend, if he's back and he should be, because Capt. Painter goes on leave the last of June and they both can't go at the same time.  Sayyy, we had the best rhubarb pie for supper last night!!  Sure was nice to have a pie all made!!  Had Cub Scouts till 5, so supper was easy with the dessert all made!  Thank you, Mother!!  We went to PTA at West School last night.  They had the 6th graders put on a program and then the violin students played a few numbers.  We didn't stay for refreshments Mrs. Kurperes (the blonde that teaches Mark's reading group in the basement now) said Mark had called her out in the hall, when I was in the hospital and told her what was wrong with Mother and said he was so concerned.  When I was here in bed one day, he came upstairs and said, \"Mother, I wish you'd get better and get up, because I don't feel good, you know, when I see you staying in bed!\"  I don't know whether he meant \"physically\" or \"mentally\" that he didn't feel good, but I assured him I'd be better in just a few days, so hope he's \"cured\" now like I am.  11:45 company came for coffee, phone rang, kids here for lunch. \n",

      "It's time for a coffee break, so will \"break\"! I am late, as usual, to say \"Happy Birthday\" to you, Helen, but I really was thinking of you Saturday! Suppose you celebrated your birthday at Emerson's sale?? Now I will have to come home to hear all about that. Should hate to miss anything, you know. Just found my letter about the nurses reunion June 26th so will have to get my money and reservation in for that. This is such a busy time again. Have a Den Mother's meeting Wednesday night, Scouts tonight and of course work. Thursday and Friday and have a big Scout picnic Sunday and I have not got the menu figured out and sent home to parents yet. Mutt is supposed to go on a trip to Duluth, New York, Chicago, Maine, and heaven knows where else next week sometime and will be gone a week. They don't know when they might leave, all depends on when they get the plane ready. Could be today, could be tomorrow, could be next week, but he will be gone for a week, anyway. He will probably come bustling in here with, I am leaving right away, are my clothes ready?\" My washer finally cooked out, after 6 1/2 years of hard use, so we are going to use the laundromat till the next housing list comes out, anyway. Base housing has washers in them, so it would be foolish to buy a new one and use it a month and store it, besides, they cost money, too! Ha!! Sears would overhaul it for $50.00, but hate to put that much in an old washer that has taken the beating this one has. Want to thank you for taking the kids to the farm Saturday!! There is not a kid for blocks around that does not turn green with envy when the boys tell that they got to herd cattle like in Rawhide, and even got to clean the barn, and they saw 35 new pigs and new kittens, and a new calf and, and, and, and.\"! Dougie's triumph was that he got to go up in the barn where they have all the hay. Just hope you survived it all. Mutt took the boys for a walk yesterday (own and a couple spares) for about three miles. While they were gone, Karen washed up the dinner dishes and baked a batch of doughnuts. Then we rode the bikes out to meet the boys and took them fresh sugared doughnuts! They sure were glad to see us, or rather, they were glad to see the doughnuts! When they got back, Mutt decided to wash the car and guess you know there was not a cloud in the sky till he started to wash the car but it rained on him. He wiped it over three times with the Chamois and as soon as he was through it quit running and there was not another drop after that! Guess the good Lord did not like him washing the car on Sunday. The kids and I planted some Zinnias, Marigolds, and asters in milk cartons last Tuesday morning and the darned things were popping through the dirt Thursday morning and the Zinnias are getting thin second leaves on them already and are a good 1 1/2 inches high already! Did not know they would sprout that fast and planned to hold off setting them out till we moved on base or found out if we were going to move but at the rate they are growing, I will have to set them out here, anyway, whether we move or not. Put some plant food on them and it must have been powerful stuff! Oh well, we can always use them for shade trees..\" Am feeling so good again now! Do not tire like I did and even look alive again, so guess I have that battle whipped! Time sure is flying! The kids will be out of school in 3 weeks. Do not know where this last year went! The kids all come home from school for lunch now and it is 11:40, so better put the soup on. Think it will be Green Pea camp! Yes, it will! That is all that is left!! Ha! Have donuts enough for dinner, too, but supper!!! Ugh! nothing even out of the freezer and supper on feast days is a headache because they do not leave, till 5 and it is always a rush order! Karen's ballet recital was Saturday night and we were real proud of her! It really was beautiful and there were over 100 children (all girls) in it. The little 3 year olds had the audience roaring with their unrehearsed antics!! Another 5 minutes gone, gotta go! you know how it is, Helen, or is not there any rush at your house???? Na! That is the joke of the year! I will quit on that one! PS Whoops! Here comes one starving kid!! got caught!!\n",

Guess that accounts for everyone but Ma, and she's not dressed yet, but decided she wanted to talk to her own Ma and Pa for a while, so here I am!

Not that it was a masterpiece, but what with interruptions and all, I was determined to get it written up whether anything else got done or not! Had about decided that they'd decided to throw it out, and then the phone rang! They better do my Father justice, too, or I'll shoot them!! I could tell them lots of things about him if they'd only ask me. I'd tell them, too, that he beats his children with leather bedroom slippers and that he can spell b-u-s-t \"bust\"!! Now that's history, isn't it? I'd tell them, too, that he raised his daughters to stop everything when the Pierce County Tribune came in the mail, and always sit in the middle of the floor to read it! There's a lot of important details like that, that I forgot to tell them! By the way, when the Tribune came yesterday and Mutt read the \"write up\" under the picture, he said, \"What does 'contributed' mean?\" And I told him that after reading it I'd say it meant \"written by m'mither\" and that Mutt Jones said, \"And all the time, I thought you got your baloney from your Father!!\" I told him I was well supplied with baloney from both sides of my family, and he thinks I absorbed more that my share of it!! Haven't done anything exciting since we were home. Oh, there've been some exciting activities like washing, and ironing, and dishes, and working, and eating, and ball games, and babysitting, but nothing real great. Hope Ed Crook got his letters from the kids. Meant to add a note to Mark's and say that I'll bet Mark was the only bowler he'd had there that got the chest and belly of his shirt dirty bowling!! They sure enjoyed that. Mutt and I went bowling Sunday night and I beat him bad!!! (Told him about it, too!) Bowled 163, 124, and 139, so you see, Daddy, I'd have beaten you this time! Ha!! (I really don't usually do that well but sure was \"hitting the ball\" that time!!) Made a big batch of doughnuts day before yesterday and Ronnie McNeal (the boys' substitute paper boy when we come to Rugby) is wild about them and had several and I finally told them they couldn't have any more before supper. Then Ronnie got in trouble and his mother put him up in his room right after supper. We were eating late and just sat down to eat when the phone rang for Richard. It was Ronnie McNeal, wanting to know that if he sneaked out of his room, would Richard throw him one of his mother's good doughnuts out the window to him!! Must have been good doughnuts! I'm the only one in the neighborhood that makes doughnuts I think, and the kids all like doughnuts. (He didn't get the doughnut!) Bought our first fresh peaches of the season this week. Paid $2.39 for a lug, and the kids are really enjoying them. Was going to can some of them, but the kids are \"canning\" them real well!! Well, how about this?? I've been here an hour getting this much written. Doug is out playing, Karen gone to baby-sit, and the twins off to play a ball game at University Park and I'm still here. The boys have the dishes done, too. They must get their speediness from their mother!! Har de har, har har!!! We sure enjoyed the reunion!! That was lots more fun than the Peace Gardens. Hope Helen survived, though! Did their cows give buttermilk that night after getting \"all shook up\" from firecrackers?? Guess I could go get dressed, and scrub the kitchen, and iron, and vacuum, and bake something and maybe make my bed. Hate to shock my family, though! When are you coming to see us?? Think you should come before Marks' summer school is over (July 29) so Mark could introduce his famous grandfather, and it should be in the papers by then, so he'd have proof. Boy, he's \"b-u-s-t\" the buttons off his shirt if he could do that!! Gotta get busy! Come and see me, please???!!!! Feel better now that I've chatted with you this morning. One-sided conversation, but I've let off steam and can really get busy now. Gotta go!! P.S., Couldn't find a pen!! Sorry!! At least I \"writ\" and that's something for me!!\n",

      "It's 8:30 a.m. so maybe if I start now I can get a letter finished before any more neighbors decide to have babies. This has been a wild week. Sunday afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Carl Nelson (Bill Oliver's sister) stopped by with the clipping from the Herald. They have a press that puts clippings, etc. between plastic, so they'll keep well, without tearing. So I ordered eight of them, one for each of the kids and one for you, and have them wrapped for mailing, but won't get them off until tomorrow. Pa took the car to work! Monday morning I drove out to the base to get Mutt's check to put in the bank, got to the bank, paid some bills, \"lunched\" the kids so the boys could go play baseball, took Karen to the beauty shop to get her hair trimmed up and set for Scout camp, came home, took off my shoes and the phone rang. It was Mutt calling. An airman's wife was having difficulties and needed to get to the doctor, so I put my shoes on again, picked up the airman's wife and 11 month old son, dropped the son off here with Karen and took \"Mama\" to the G.I. clinic. Waited while she saw the doctor, took her across the street to Deaconess Hospital (ran into Rev. Brandt there) got her admitted and came home again. Little \"Tony\" had cried all the while we were gone. He got quiet, so finally got the carrots, onions and potatoes in the roast (that was already done!) and we ate at 7:30.Then Airman Windish came and I heated the supper and got him fed and he and his son went home. They got a daughter Tuesday p.m. Karen and I got busy then packing her footlocker and getting her name on all her camp stuff. Tuesday morning we got up early because Karen went to camp that day. Mutt had planned to drive, since it was 122 miles up there, but they had a mission planned at the base, so the kids and I were moving fast to get a picnic lunch ready and everybody got their own cereal and toast and milk! About 8 a.m. Mrs. Martin (next door) came over and said, \"I'm not feeling so good.\" Called the base trying to find her husband. Couldn't find him so finally called Mutt and he ran him down and sent him home. In the meantime, got her minister's family to come get the two boys and I took her to the hospital. (Oh yes, had her call her doctor first and he said to admit her.) Then Mutt called and said the computers were out of commission, mission was canceled and if I would go out and get him, he'd drive the car, soooo picked up another Girl Scout and got her trunk loaded, out to the base to get Pa, and back and finally got out of here at 11 a.m. Was glad he drove, too, because the last 20 miles was through woods on gravel roads and I am sure I could have managed to get on the wrong trail! (By the way, Mrs. Martin came back home yesterday, undelivered and is she disgusted!!) I had the Martin boys Tuesday and Wednesday and then yesterday morning.Richard slept at Martin's Tuesday night and Rodney Wednesday night, so in case Ronald had to leave during the night the boys could bring the little Martin boys over here when they woke up in the morning. Mutt was in Canada Wednesday and Thursday and got back in time for me to go to work last night. He took the boys to a ball game last night, so they're all happy. Don't have a thing planned for today! Have had the ironing board up all week and have managed to get quite a bit of it done in between times, but still have a bagful in the freezer. Richard went down to get a loaf of bread out of the freezer this morning and came up and said, \"Looked in the freezer and thought we'd have to have shirts for breakfast this morning.\" Think he takes after his father and his grandfather with the wise cracks out here sometimes. The Girl Scout camp looked like it was going to be lots of fun. It smelled so \"pine-y\" and good in the woods and it was loaded with ripe raspberries! Shore was peaceful up that-a-way. By the way, we really enjoyed the raspberries and peaches you sent us! Dougie calls them \"Grandma's berries\", but whatever you call them, those \"Grandma berry\" short cakes with ice cream tasted good. We have two pair of little canvas shoes we found in the car, that don't belong here, and a flashlight we found in the tent, so must get those mailed to the Krohns. Would hate to have those little Krohn kids going barefoot in the snow, and it's almost wintertime again.  I owe everyone letters again, but most of them will wait for answers till school gets in session again. When are you coming to see us?? Think you should come here and then we should go to Bemidji or Itaska park or someplace like that. We were close to Bemidji when we took Karen and Phyllis Pearson to Scout camp, 22 miles east and north of Clearbrook, Minnesota, but time was too short to go on to Bemidji. Wellll, reckon I better go get dressed and get my shovel out again and start shoveling out here again. It isn't too deep, so shouldn't take too long if I don't get interrupted again. Didn't think that was the prettiest picture I'd ever seen of you, Daddy, but it's no wonder you looked scared., It looks like Mom had a vegetable peeler or something like that in her hand! Was she threatening you with it?? Richard and Rodney came charging up the stairs Sunday morning about 10 minutes to 6 yelling, \"Grandpa made the front page news!\" Took me a few seconds to wake up enough to realize what they were saying. Thought by the wild excitement that there was a fire in the house or something drastic had happened to somebody, so was relieved when I woke all the way up and discovered it was \"Grandpa Foy\" that caused all the Sunday morning confusion. (Frankfully, I could have cheerfully strangled them at that time of morning, but didn't want to stick a pin in their bubble of enthusiasm, so struggled till I could get my eyes open enough to read, and read the article under their supervision!) Mark just came in and said, \"Gosh, you must have a mind that works good, cuz you sure write long letters!\" Doug was in just a minute ago and informed that he was going to be a man before David Martin was, because David wouldn't be 5 until September and he (Doug) would be 5 this month!! When my sons think we'll have shirts for breakfast, and you become a man at 5, and you have a mind that works good because you write long letters, it's time to sign off, so will do just that!!! P.S. Really write long letters just to be sure I get my 4 cents worth!\n",

      "Happy Birthday, Daddy!! Your ears should really burn today because you are going to be talked about in school. Richard has had your newspaper article hanging in his room since school started and I heard Rodney tell Richard that he would be in to get it this morning so he could \"tell\" it to his roomful of kids! See how famous you are??\" It is 8.30 A.M. and the dead silence has just fallen over the house. Imagine the same silence fell over your your house after we all got out of there Sunday! Hope you have caught your second breath by now, mom. It seems that every time we leave there, you look so tired and whipped that I feel guilty as sin. You spend the whole time in the kitchen and do not seem to have a minute to sit down and enjoy. Oh, sure, we all bring a cake, or bread, or bars and everybody peels a potato, or slices tomato or pickles, but the brunt of the responsibility falls on you and by the time you sit down to the table you look like you are ready to fold up. I do not know where the solution lies, heaven only knows, but something has to give or you are going to \"give out\" one of these Sundays and be in bed for a week! What are your plans for Christmas?? Would you let me know soon and I will get a line off to the others and feel we could plan to bring the whole Sunday (Christmas dinner, that is) so you could sit down and visit just once!! There is no reason why I could not bring a turkey, washed and ready to put in the oven, with the dressing with the celery and onions in it already. for stuffing (yeah, I would stuff it just before we put it in the oven) and somebody else could bring the fresh vegetables ready for the table, and somebody else could bring the sweet potatoes, almost done, but just to finish heating, I can get buns here at the bakery so cheap there is no sense in baking them, then if everybody brought some baked goods, we would be pretty well ready and it would not be such a headache for you. Then if one of us took the responsibility of the table setting, one the gravy and mashed potatoes corner, and one mother with the help of Sandra and Karen to keep the little ones entertained and playing games instead of fighting, wrestling and playing on the stairway, perhaps you could go through the weekend without the wear and tear on your nerves that I know you have when those kids get going and you stand in the kitchen and sweat and wonder which one is going to break a leg first or put a foot through a window or something. We all enjoy coming home so much and it is so good to be able to get together once in awhile, but it is not fair that you get it all on your shoulders! We all love you both to pieces and thoroughly enjoy coming home, but believe if everybody pitches in then maybe you could have a minute to enjoy all of us and still be able to breathe and to see straight when we left. Amen! My sermon is over, but please let me know if Christmas is going to be at your house, if you are going to Washington, or Williston, or Grand Forks, we will all let you in (if I get a good look at Daddy's face through the glass i the door! Ha!!) and we will take it from there. I know the rest of the kids feel the same way I do about this, and feel we can work it out to be a while of a lot lighter on you, mom! (Mark would be glad to prepare the cranberry relish! He is an expert now, you know. He sure enjoyed his weekend this time. Said it was the most fun he had ever had at grandma's and grandpa's) By the way, how did that 1/2 of angel food cake get in the cake pan?!!!! Opened the lid and was dumbfounded, took only 1 chocolate cake home this time and came back with 1/2 angel food and 1/2 of a chocolate cake and a whole pie!!! Boy, we really made a haul!! Karen got so many compliments on her green print blouse and one was from a 9th grade girl (that is like \"way out\", man!!, Ha) so she was real thrilled!! The music stand has been up and really in use!! We had Juneberry pie for supper last night (Thank you!), Karen is wearing a white scarf on her head to school, (thank you!), we had cranberry relish with our chicken and dumplings last night (thank you!), a pair of corduroy pants went off to school today (thank you!), and I have a new scarf I have worn for two days now (thank you!) Dougie has a mow plant growing in his cowboy hat cereal bowl (thank you!) and we had \"sloppy Joe's\" for supper Sunday night (special \"thank you\" for that because it was 7.30 when we got here and it was so nice to have it ready to heat and eat!) I could go on for pages, but must sign this off and get on the ball. Mutt has to have a new zipper in a pr. puniform trousers and he has to have them by tonight because he is going to great falls tomorrow for a couple days. Have to pay the car payment, and get some scout stuff, and value aid for Rodney's trumpet, and mace need for Richard's clarinet, and check on Boy scout uniforms), and run, run, run! Somebody better get some washing and ironing done, too!! Do not know who will have time for that, though!! Our cub scout den is going to put on a skit this month, too. We are going to use the Thanksgiving one out of your pack 1 Teen magazines mom. Thank you both for the fun weekend and we will be waiting to hear from you about Christmas plans. Have so many things I would like to do, but so much that has to be done first, that it really does not leave much spare time. Mutt is going to start having Boy scouts here on Monday nights and of course I have Cuds Tuesday and work Thursday and Friday. Gee, wonder what I will ever find to do on that long Wednesday evening!! Maybe just join a \"bridge club\" Na!! That is a joke!! Have a lot of things I would rather do than play bridge! Gotta get moving!! Should hate to get fired from this lovely job!! I am sure there would be people clammering at the door to get this job in this mansion with the dirty dishes, dirty clothes, ironing, etc., so I had better get to work before the boss comes home!!! \n",

      "\"12 minutes past 9 o'clock\" the radiomen just said! I'm not dress yet, but have clothes washing, dishes soaking and banana cakes in the oven so I'm not a total loss. Yikes! Just looked up when I heard a hammer pounding outside my kitchen window and saw a man's head! He put up a sign that said \"CWO Jones\", so now maybe the kids will find the right house. Richard almost walked into Dr. Burton's house yesterday at noon and noticed the name plate before he turned the doorknob. He felt like 2 cents when he started to turn the door knob and happened to look at the name plate at the same timem because \"Capt. Burch's\" name was on this house and \"Capt. Burton\" on the other one. He sure got out of there fast. Tried to tell him he should have gone on in because she might have had something better to eat there, but he decided to stay here. The base school is under the Grand Forks school district so changing schools was no problem because they still have the same textbooks, same band teacher (thank heavens! 'After just starting to pay on 2 band instruments' Whew!!) Karen rides the bus in to school. Dorothy Painter had supper all fixed the night we moved in and Laura Watson sent a pot of hot coffee over so we'd have coffee all afternoon while we were running back and forth. Jean Melby brought a cake over the next night, one of the neighbors took the boys to Boy Scouts, another saw to it that Karen got to go to a Jr. teen roller skating party so she'd meet all the kids and everyone has really gone out of their way to get us settled. Really appreciate it all. Mutt is in Great Falls again. Left Monday and I'm supposed to pick him up this afternoon (in town). He said they asked him at work if all the furniture was moved around and settled and he said \"no\" and they sent him to Great Falls so he wouldn't have to help me!! The apartment was spotless when we moved in here. Think it's the first time I've ever moved in anyplace without having to clean at least the cupboards. I washed the insides of the windows, windowsills, all the floors, all the closets, drawers and shelves in the other place we left, though, and washed the bathroom walls and most of the kitchen walls outside all the kitchen cupboards and waxed the livingroom and bathroom and scoured everything, so it was cleaner than when we moved in there! Hope they appreciate it!! I'm really enjoying the dryer! Boy, I don't hang any more socks!! Think I have more washing, though, because there are no sidewalks or grass around the school, just piles of black dirt and Doug has really been hard on his brothers since he got here. He slid down a hill one day on his way home from school and there was snow park way, but the last half of the \"slide\" was mud!! He hasn't slid on anymore hills since then, though. He got lost coming home from school the first day, and Mutt went looking for him and found him wandering around the Airmen's housing area, totally unconcerned!! I asked him what he'd have done if Daddy hadn't picked him up, because I was sure he didn't know our new address since we'd moved in after dark the night before. He looked at me so disgusted and said, \"Well, Mother!! I was looking for Cedar St. and I was looking for a two-one-two!\" I won't worry now, because he can at least tell someone where he lives if he misses the right corner. Was dumbfounded that he knew the building number and street name, though! He was supposed to have waiting for one of the twins, but after all!! He's 5!! And that's real big, too, you know!! The boys were supposed to have taken him on the road to school and had \"short-cutted\" through the yards and alleys and he figured he could \"short-cut\" home by himself, too, but he sticks to the road now. Have 3/4 of the livingroom straightened out but that other 1/4 is really pretty, boxes and piles of stuff I haven't decided where to hide!! Did Margie change her mind about having that baby?? Was wondering if you'd come and see us, Daddy, while Mom is off gallivanting in Williston? We'd come and get you if you'd come?? Or come on the train and we'll get you there?? Our phone number is 4736 so all you do is call Grand Forks 978-4736 and we're it! I'm serious about this now, Daddy, so if you'll just let us know we'll pick you up anyplace (except Minneapolis or New York, that is!!) Thought I'd better add that or you would!! Ha Ha Gotta get these dishes washed. Kids all come home at noon now, too, (except Karen) so have to have lunch ready on time now, too. Let me know if we can \"have\" you a while, Daddy. We'd sure like that!! You can go play Bingo with us Tuesday night, too!! Don't think they give away any outboard motors or registered bulls, but they do have prizes! Gotta go! Will be waiting for word to come and get you, Daddy! P.S. Forgot to tell you I had Myron Fakey's Dad as a pt a couple weeks ago. Also that Louis Hagen said he lived right across from Louis DuPuis' little house that he has now on the north side there. Also said he used to buddy around with the fellow from the creamery. Nielon knows Ed Cross, too. Feel so sorry for him because he gets so lonesome and loves company so much. Doesn't know anyone in Grand Forks, though.\n",

      "Can you smell the chili cooking?? Smells good from here! Kids are all at the pool, so decided to take advantage of these few minutes and get a line off to you. By the sounds of your letter, Mom, you people have really had the company. Sure sounded like fun and just think of all the good chatter I missed out on! Darn it all, anyway! Things manage to keep exciting around here, too! Richard and Rodney went fishing last week and we had fried fish for supper (catfish). It was their first catch worth eating and they were good fish. Yesterday the boys went hiking and brought in cattails and black-eyed susans, and a turtle! We now have a banana box on the floor in Mark's and Doug's bedroom with sand in the bottom of it, a private sunken swimming pool (pie pan) with sundeck (rock) and one turtle about 3 inches in diameter. After we got the housework pretty well done today, Mark and Rodney went fishing as it was cloudy, but by the time they got out there, the sun came out bright and it got real hot so they didn't fish. Doug, Richard, Karen, and I fixed a picnic lunch and walked out there at noon and here were those boys catching tadpoles and \"crawdads\". We picked fresh blackberries on our walk back and ate too many so didn't have enough for a pie, but they were sure good. Rodney and Mark thought they knew where there were a whole bunch of blackberries, so took a paper bag and went to pick blackberries. Someone else had gotten there first, so instead of blackberries, they came back with a fuzzy caterpillar on a twig. At the present time we now have: one turtle in his private apartment, one jar of water with two crawdads, one jar of water with tadpoles (food for the turtle and does he love 'em!), and one jar with dirt in the bottom and leaves and twigs and a caterpillar in it.We hatched a moth from a chrysalis last week and he's already mounted in an insect box. All the boys are working on their insect badge and no bug is safe around here! Now for news of my better half. He was called down to the commander's office at Goose Bay Air Defense Center (not to his colony's office there at the site, but the \"center\" commander's) when the promotion list came out and told he was most deserving of the promotion and the colonel was dumbfounded not to see his name on the list (they promoted 742 warrants out of a possible 1400!) and said he was going to check to see why. Well, they chased it to Grand Forks, and there Lieutenant Colonel Silvernail had written an ER on Mutt when he left there and hadn't shown it to Mutt, but had it attached to his records! He down-graded Mutt 4 blocks lower than he'd ever been graded before (in over 20 years!) and had him classified as a \"very fine officer\" which means in general, that you do the duties assigned but at the same time doesn't give credit for the extra jobs he had and responsibilities he had which they wouldn't delegate to Silvernail because he wasn't capable. There is a regulation which entitles every man to see his ER before it is attached to his records and challenge it if he thinks it unjust. This makes the ER worthless and Grand Forks is now in the process of contesting the ER and it will be discarded from Mutt's record and replaced with what he deserves. Here's the catch, though! This ER was on the record when the promotion board reviewed them, and as Mutt says, \"What were they to presume but that after 20 years of Excellent and Outstanding ERs and then a man completes his 20 years and immediately drops 4 blocks lower, it appears as though his idea is that now that he has 20 years in, he doesn't give a darn and is just going along for the ride!\" There is no way he can get the promotion until next year, though, as they had 742 promotions to pass out this year and they passed out 742, so he's out of luck on that. What really was nasty, was that Silvernail wasn't authorized even to write the ER because he hadn't worked over Mutt the required number of days (60 I believe) to even have any right to write it. To make matters more interesting, Silvernail was to be \"forced retired\" when Kennedy decided to call up the reserves, etc, and and retained these \"forced retirees\" for 2 more years, because he had been passed over twice on promotion to Lieutenant Colonel as being \"unqualified\", but when Kennedy extended him the 2 years they had to make him Lieutenant Colonel!! He worked on the \"TOR\" team with Mutt and Captain Painter for awhile right after they came back from Kansas City the summer of 1959 when we came to Grand Forks, but that didn't last long, as they put Silvernail on shift work because he couldn't handle responsibility and it also hurt his ego when they left Mutt on there the whole 3 years we were there and also made Mutt \"Eyes Only\" officer (the only one that knew when these alerts were going to be pulled). Think the man was jealous and decided he'd be dirty and that he was!! At the time of this promotion business, they were also getting set for a big \"ORI\" exercise at the site at Goose Bay, and the evaluation team from the states just sent them their report. They passed with an \"outstanding\" rating, and I quote from Mutt's letter. \"Now the cream for sour apples and I quote, 'The Recovery Officer, Weapon Assignment Officer, Air Surveillance Officer, Interceptor Director, and Identification Officer performed in such a manner that only outstanding knowledge and devotion to duty could allow them to function in the manner just completed.'\" Now Mutt holds 2 of those 5 positions that were rated outstanding!! Needless to say, he is very bitter, however, he does not blame the promotion board, because they have time to judge only by the records in front of them and Silvernail's dirty work was on there! Unjustly and illegally, but it was there, and did the damage that can't be rectified. That stinker has the nicest wife and their little boys walked by our house to school, and many and many's the time I took them to school with Doug and Mark and brought them home when it was so cold. Their kids are cute as can be! Don't know the oldest boy, as he ran away from home and joined the Navy while we were in Grand Forks, but the little boys are cute as can be and well behaved little fellows. Silvernail himself is quite effeminate with blonde, curly hair and I overheard quite a few comments about it in Grand Forks (at the base) and several of the men made comments about the \"Silvernail touch\" in regards to the way he held his liquor glass so daintily with his little finger curled out so pretty, but never dreamed he was capable of such poison. Mutt will be home for a day or so the middle of August, and by that time he should have something in writing from Grand Forks. We'll sure be glad to see him, I tell you!! Had a letter from him today saying he was being sent to \"Saglik\" yesterday for 5 days, so Lieutenant Sharples could come to Goose Bay to get his necessary paperwork taken care of to \"rotate\" (return to states). He was in Grand Forks, he's served his year in Labrador and is being sent to New York. His wife (German girl) is still in Larimore. This letter of his was written at 3 AM as he'd just gotten home from work. They'd called a surprise exercise to check them on coming up to full battle duty and they accomplished it in record time. Good to know they're a sharp team up there, anyway! Tell Pat we'll take that red headed boy, anytime!! Bet he was supposed to be mine!! My neighbor (due July 2) still hasn't delivered and is getting pretty uncomfortable. Kids are in from the pool, starved as usual. Better feed them. Enjoyed our chat!!\n",

      "Just took all the kids to vacation Bible school, so will take a few minutes to  tell you we are really not dead or haven't left the country. Mutt came home Tuesday 7th at 6:30 AM and left yesterday morning at 10. Sure hated to see him go again but we had a wonderful vacation while he was here. We went to Washington DC one morning and went through part of the Smithsonian Institute and the aquarium in the department of commerce. Saw Sheppard's capsule in the aerospace building and the Kitty Hawk of the Wright brothers, and the animals of every description in the main part of the Smithsonian. You could spend a couple days there and still not see all there is to see. Mutt and I went to DC alone early one morning and went to the Pentagon to look at his service records. Saw them all, and Silvernail's ER is still in there, but after seeing it, I can't see there was anything exactly derogatory in it, it just neglected to mention all the extra projects and jobs he's had and completed with high praise. Mutt talked by phone to the fellow in the WO promotion office and he said that they turned down fellows with over 20 years service because they thought they'd take the promotion and run. This doesn't make sense because Mutt is regular instead of reserve and the Air Force can hold him for 30 years if they desire. The fellow said there were a lot of burned up warrants and he felt they had a reason to be burned up, but once a promotion has been doled out, they can only take it away by court-martial. They can't tell you why you weren't selected, where you stood promotion-wise, what they judged on or anything, so you really can find out very little. After talking to that fellow, he called the man in charge of retirement and he said he thought Mutt would have little trouble getting retirement approved and also told him to try to arrange to get his eye operated on at once and they'd have to send him to Walter Reed and if they'd transfer him to the Department of Patients there, and Mutt would notify him, he'd have him out of service in three weeks. We went up to see Colonel Falletta in his office in the Pentagonwhile we were there. He and Mutt and Prottenglier worked together in Albuquerqueerque. He asked what the h___ Mutt was doing here and when Mutt told him checking on retirement, he started telling him how much the service needed men like him, so before he went any further, Mutt  told him about the promotion list and why he was retiring. Colonel Falletta had his feet up on his desk and when he heard that Mutt didn't make the promotion, his feet hit the floor so fastI thought he was going to fall out of his chair! He says, wellllll after hearing that I guess I can save my speech! He's an old Texas boy and common as an old shoe (looks like that short one of the Abbet and Costello team) but is a brilliant fellow according to Mutt. Course he and Mutt were going back-and-forth with remember this time and what ever happened to so-and-so, and they caught up on a lot of fellows that one or the other had lost track of. Know they both enjoyed the visit and they both had some good laughs on memories of Albuquerqueerque. We went back to DC another day and rode the elevator to the top of the Washington Monument and walked down!! Thought my knees would never quit bending even after I got out on the sidewalk. The view from the top of that is beautiful!! Mutt went to the Federal Aviation Agency to check on job qualifications, etc., while we toured the monument, and then we all went to the Lincoln Memorial and then to the wax museum and by the time we got back to the car, we were really beat! Still want to see the White House and the Capitol on the inside before we leave here. Traffic is terrific, though! We went to DC to a Sears store one day, too, and got the kids clothes for school (and three new dresses for me for my birthday!!). Mark and Doug had an extra good birthday because Daddy was home. They each had a cake and it was another one of those unplanned birthday parties before it was over. Had 26 people that finally got cake, ice cream, and punch or coffee! Started out with just the two girls across the hall, and the four kids next-door to them, and then the mamas came in and then the daddys came home from work, and then Rodney's, Richard's, and Mark's buddies heard there was cake and all came to visit! It was fun though and Mutt met all the neighbors (except the prostitutes next-door! I didn't introduce him to them!!!).  Saturday morning we drove to Annapolis to the Naval Academy so the boys could see that, and really lucked out! They were having a big parade and review for Change of Command and it was really impressive! We got there at 10:45 AM and the program and parade started at 11 AM. Don't know how often they change commands at an Academy, but we really hit it at the right time. We drove up towards Baltimore one day, too, and out to Fort Meade several times. Mutt had dinner with retired Colonel Davis (retired from Grand Forks in June '61) while I went commissarying at Fort Meade one day. At any rate, we did a little housekeeping except for eating and washing dishes while Mutt was home and it sure looks it today!! He and the boys were at the pool a couple hours every day and he got a nice suntan (burned, too, but where it's peeling, it's tan underneath!) and they really hung onto him and he looked like the Pied Piper every time he went out the door! He had a gang of boys at the ballpark playing baseball a couple days, too. Really utilized every minute he had and know he hated to head back, but left with a letter all written to the Secretary of the Air Force requesting immediate retirement and stating his reasons why. This will go (properly) through channels so will be endorsed by his CO at the site, the CO at Goose Bay Air Defense Command, then to Colorado Springs to be endorsed and then to the secretary of the Air Force and back to Mutt, so will likely take several months, but we at least know definitely now that he is going to retire (if they approve it and they'd better now!!) at least by April 1. As soon as he gets a retirement date, he can start checking on employment, but must have a definite date before anyone will even accept an application, which is understandable. Found out several other things about several of the WO's that made the promotion. Smith (at Grand Forks) was an alcoholic and supposed to work in weather, but came to work so drunk so often that he couldn't navigate nor do his work, so was sent to the motor pool to work where he didn't have to do any technical work. Albright, who was with us in South Carolina and visited us in Alubquerque and in Michigan and had same date of rank as Mutt but less years of service, had been thrown out of Alaska by the commander there because he would get along with no one and caused so much dissention among the personnel. He made W3, though. When Colonel Davis heard they made Kimbrell and not Mutt, his reply was, That d___ fellow never did anything but sit on his a__ the whole time he was in Grand Forks! Made him so mad, that he is writing a letter to Director of Personnel in DC, just to express his opinion! Says it will be his first act as a civilian, but it might help make them wake up and revise their promotional policies. At any rate, we've had a wonderful vacation, seen lots of the country, and know we'll all remember these few days a long, long time. Guess I've yakked long enough (an hour and a half), and wanted to wash my dirty wig before the kids come home, so guess I'd better go stick my head in the sink! Lots of love to both of you and will let you know what we hear on retirement.\n",

      "Just want to wish you a Happy Mother's Day, a Happy Father's Day, Happy Anniversary, a Jolly 4th of July, a Happy Thanksgiving, a Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, a sweet Valentine's Day and a Happy Easter!! You think I'm a little loco?? Nope! You're wrong!! What I'm trying to tell you is that you'd better rearrange your furniture or shove your washer over or something, because Sears is delivering you a drier!! As you know we've \"talked\" a drier for you for some time, several years in fact. Well, we went to Porterville a couple weeks ago and while we were there, we put flowers on Grandma and Grandpa Jones' graves. I knew Mutt was doing a lot of thinking and knew he'd tell me what he was thinking when he got ready to, if I left him alone. After we got home, he said, \"Do you know what we're giving your Mother and Dad for Mother's Day and Father's Day?\" I said \"no\" and he said, \"a drier\". He said we'd all talked about it for several years, but that it was almost impossible to get seven people together to decide what to do about it and the years go by too fast, and you continued to wash bedding when we all visit there and haul wet sheets and towels all over to dry, while we tried to decide what to do about a drier! Well, you should have it in a few days, and I like it, because I got to pick it out!! We aren't trying to \"impress\" anybody, or \"outshine\" other gifts you get, because often little gifts are more fun than big gifts and I hope the other kids don't feel that we're trying to be big shots, because we're not. If you lived in a warm climate it wouldn't be so bad, but remember we spent three winters there, too! I know you'll enjoy it during the winter months. I like a drier especially for socks and towels! They seem to come out so much fluffier and softer! We ordered the drier through the Sears store hire and then they wired Minot to see if they'd accept the order and deliver the drier to you from their store in Minot and the wire just came back this morning, so I thought I'd better write fast as you'd be looking for it. Now, please don't write and _____ us out for sending the drier, because we'll just sit down and laugh if you do and you'd just be wasting all that energy! Ha, Ha, Ha!! We've had the TV on since early this morning to see Cooper take off into space and then he didn't go!! When they said the radar wasn't working, Doug said, \"Gee, they should have called Daddy!\" Mutt is going to school again, all day, at Norton (San Bernardino) to serve as air Surveillance officer. He's an \"Identification Officer\" and is a little disgusted to think he has to learn all those \"Sids\" and \"Dids\" (Symbols of some sort) all over again when he plans to retire next year. He can't put in his retirement papers until Nov. 1st, anyway, and the blamed CO is trying to talk him out of it again. I really don't care whether he stays in or gets out, as long as they don't send him someplace we can't go, too. Hey! The Sears store just called and I discover you have to have a 220 outlet for the drier! Jeeminy Crickets!! Is that going to create a problem?? If so, and you'd rather have a gas dryer then you can call them at Minot and have them bring you that kind instead, just whichever you want! I went to the dentist yesterday. Saw a Doctor JB Ledfors, DDS. He's a nut!! But more fun! He was questioning me about my ear because his little Johnnie has one just like mine only his is folded clear over and it's his left ear, too! Isn't that strange? Coincidence?? Something, anyway. Still haven't met his wife or kids, but have talked to her a couple times on the phone. Plan to have Uncle Gus' and Uncle Johns' and Freddie's family all over for a picnic supper one night while Frances and Bruce are here so we can meet them all. That oughta be fun!! 17 kids and 10 adults'. It better not rain or we'll have to hang them from the rafters!! 'Course I have a nice big table that has held a lot of food for a lot of people for a lot of years!! Don't have many chairs, because whoever had that table had a bunch of kids that wore out the chairs! Don't know who those kids were, do you?? I know I had my name underneath one of them!! Probably had a wad of gum under it, too!! Monday night we went to the Football stadium at \"Poly\" High School to watch the presentation of awards for the ROTC. Sib's boy was a T/Sgt this year and got \"commissioned\" so he will be a 2nd lieutenant next year. He sure is a nice boy. They came over and had coffee and ice cream afterwards and we gabbed until 11:30P.M. Don't think Sib and I will ever get caught up on all our chatter!! We're working at it every minute we can, thought! Think I'd better go throw in a load of colored clothes or Doug will be hollering for some in the morning! I cleaned his room yesterday and found one dirty sock from each of 4 or 5 pairs, so he no doubt has no clean pairs for tomorrow! Oh, by the way, Mutt might be going to Grand Forks for a \"Tactical Evaluation\" sometime next month or in July and hopes to get to Rugby if he does. It's all \"might\" and \"hopes\" right now but it sounds good, anyway! Gotta get busy! My goodness it's your \"first-born's\" birthday today and she's 41!! Gee, is she getting old!!! I'd sure hate to be 40!! Ha!! I can laugh for a couple more months anyway!! Call her up, will you, Daddy, and tell her that her young sister wishes her a Happy Birthday!! Thank you!! Be good!! and Frances and I will have an extra cup of coffee for when they come to see us next month. Gotta go!! \n",

      "Five after 9 a.m. and waiting for the washer to finish spinning and I can put out the second load of wash. Have the breakfast dishes (Ha!!) soaking and am already dressed, carried out the garbage, played with the baby awhile and watered the flowers, so I have earned my cup of coffee this morning. You did not know we had a new baby??? Oh, it is another boy!! Has four legs and a bark and is called \"Peanuts.\" He is 7 weeks old and moved in here from the dog pound lost saturday and belongs to Mark and Doug. Blessed thing cried all night Saturday and Sunday, but gave up and slept in the garage last night. He is a cute little light tan short haired Heinz 57 variety. Did those Sears people deliver that drier yet? Expect our letters will cross on the way and I will have my answer before this letter reaches you. Sadie wrote and said you had gotten the letter and knew the drier was coming, and then added more to the letter and said she had been to Minot and saw Pat and she had called Sears to tell them that Pat and Don would deliver it and they had not called her back. I checked here and the paperwork is all through and it is added to our account so they had better deliver it! Don't I sound rough and mean though?!!! Ha! A week ago last Friday evening we were sitting around here and there was a knock at the door and here was uncle John and Lolita and the kids. First time I had met Lolita and the kids. She sure is sweet and their kids are real cute. Johnnie looks like his dad and Jina Marie has the dark hair like Lolita, but a very fair complexion. She went to their house for \"hamburgers\" Saturday and they were the funniest hamburgers I ever saw!! They had a big steak for each of the kids (even Doug and Jina and Johnnie) and for the \"old\" folks, too. We had the nicest day! This past Sunday mama Jene had Sid's family and us over for a picnic dinner and we had the nicest time there, too! We ate till we were ready to pop, and just talked and talked and talked! Sid and Louis' and we Joneses are planning to go to the beach next sunday if the weather is decent. Then we are looking for Frances and Bruce and kids about the 13th. The 16th we are having a picnic in the backyard and so far we have 8 Shulers, 7 Joneses, 2 Sedelius', 4 DuPrees, 4 John Ledfors' and 6 Freddy Ledfors' coming. Uncle Gus goes on vacation the 14th so will be gone on Sunday, but if Shulers get here the 13th we will have to see that we catch Uncle Gus before they leave. He would really express his opinion if they did not come over! He says what he thinks, so you do not have to wonder what he is thinking! I like that! He thinks that \"family\" is the greatest thing invented and is so nice to everyone. You can come \"picnic\" with us, too!! Went to see Freddy's wife one day last week. They have 4 beautiful little girls. The oldest and the lady are redheads and the other two are more blonde. One is 6, one 4, one 2 1/2, and one a year old. \"Coke\" (Freddy's wife) is nice! She is reddish haired and is 5'10\" tall!! am sure their 6 year old is bigger than Dougie and here he is almost 8! Freddie is over 6' tall, too, so guess they have pretty good sized parents compared to those Jones kids parents! Our kids still have school all next week. Sure is late. Was surprised when Sadie said you and Helen had been up to get John. School must be out there almost a month earlier than here. Mark is having troubles! Someone has swiped two sets of drumsticks since he got here, so Mutt bought him another set yesterday and you should see how Mark \"marked\" them. I will tell you, no one will steal these in school! He painted them blue like his drum and sprinkled them with glitter and is going to shellac them in school today! He left a hand place and the tips plain, but I am telling you they will see them 1/2 mile away!! He sure enjoys his drums! The Sierra Jr. His bands had a \"night of music\" that lasted two hours and really was good. There is a Beginner's Band, an Intermediate band, a dance band (and were they good!!!), an advanced band, and an advanced orchestra, and one bandmaster directs the whole bunch!! Mark tried out and got first choir in drums in the Beginner's Band. Rodney has second choir first trumpet in Intermediate and Richard is second choir, second clarinet. There are three times as many Clarinets as trumpets. Both the twins go into advanced Band next year, and have not heard from Mark, but imagine he will move up to Intermediate Band. Started Karen back on piano and she really practices. She has only had 7 months of lessons (when she was in 5th and 6th grades), but the teacher put her into 2nd grade music. Her teacher is from Norway (no, Daddy, she does not drive from Norway every week, she lives in Riverside now! Ha! I knew I left myself wide open there!!), and has six children and gives her an hour music lesson for $3.00 and another teacher I called wanted $3.50 for 1/2 hour and only 20 minutes would be piano and 10 minutes \"theory\". Mutt has finished up his \"school\" here and took his tests. He only got a 96 out of a possible 100 and was disgusted. A major came in and \"briefed\" them just before the test and Mutt, questioned one part of his briefing \"and told the Major that their instructor had given them a different solution, but the Major insisted he was right! That is the one mistake Mutt made on the test! Two other warrants (both made W-3 last year when Mutt did not) who have been working here for almost 2 years, using this stuff they were tested on, took the test, too, and one got a 68 and one an 84!! 80 was \"passing\". The W.O. board has met again for this year but the list is not out yet. Mutt got the highest E.R. Efficiency Report they can give, (and requires endorsement by 4 \"command\" colonels before it can be sent in) and their little squadron on the hill in Labrador won the \"Presidential Unit Citation\" while he was there, so if they do not promote him this time, I know General LeMay will be receiving correspondence and impressions of a WO and suggestions for improvement of promotion policy! He is going to put in his retirement papers this fall as soon as he can, anyway, but he has earned the promotion and I would sure like to see him get it. It would mean a pay raise, but that is not as important as the morale viewpoint. He is as bitter, but still works hard and gets complements from the commander, but when he sees these other warrants flunk tests and still got the promotions, I guess he cannot help but be bitter. am glad Frances and Bruce are coming, because company seems to get his mind off it and he really enjoys company. Well I am running out of paper and I had better quit, anyway. I am going to go visit with aunt Sally this afternoon for a little while before kids come home from school. I called her to be sure she was going to be home and was not having company, so we can really visit. no more room! Gotta go!\n",

      "It rained all night so it's damp and muggy out there this morning. Needed the rain, though, so won't complain. Kids are all asleep and Mutt gone to work and it's soooooo quiet I can scarcely stand it! Just finished using my black stripe on my clean nurses cap and have a uniform to touch up next. My cap has a name tape on it that says \"Betty Ann Fay\" so you know how old that cap is, but it looks good as new. Doug and Karen register for school today, Mark tomorrow and the twins Friday. School doesn't start until the 11th though. Have to have Doug down to the school at 9 and then I'm due at work at 9:30 this morning. I'll be back at noon and don't know if I'll work this afternoon at all or not. Doctor Kanter hasn't set up his schedule for nurses yet, but will this week. Tried to call Lolita yesterday but she wasn't home. Saw Uncle John's name in the list of people playing in the Labor Day Golf tournament here. He didn't win. We had a nice vacation, but spent so much of it on the road it seemed. Madeline surprised me with a big birthday cake! I didn't know she even knew when my birthday was! Also saw the Van Keurens while we were there. You remember them, don't you? She was the red headed opera singer that lived next door to us in Grand Forks. Van has been going to night school for years and finally got his degree, so is retiring next May and they're moving to Santa Rosa and he will teach there. They have added a son (11months old) to their 4 daughters as she said that's what you call \"keeping up with the Joneses\"! Sibyl and a girl friend of Karen's came over Sunday afternoon and I got the three of them started on cake decorating. Sibyl has ordered the tips and I'm going to show her what to do with them. Karen and Dianne will just use mine and take turns with them. Louis and Louis Jr had gone mountain climbing, so Sib and Mike stayed for supper and we had the best gab fest and Mutt was on the floor playing games with the kids and we really had a nice day. Than you so much for the rug! Now I want to dye my bedspread a deeper pink and get some aqua and brown curtains up in there and put that rug in our bedroom. Will look nice if and when I get it done! I washed clothes all day Monday (after all, that's what Labor Day is for, isn't it??) so now you should see the mountain of ironing! By the time I get it all ironed, the kids will have outgrown it!! Have 4 new paris of trousers sitting here with the cuffs pinned up and guess that will have to be the first project. Have to have new trousers the first day of school, you know! Twins have been working on merit badges and hope to get their \"Life\" badges completed by next week and then can start on the big one, \"Eagle\". That will take awhile, but this service life has really helped them on their Scouting because they've seen so many things and have done so many things that ca be applied toward badges. They're working on their \"Citizenship in the Nation\" and have visited the \"House\" and \"Senate\" both, and the Supreme Court (in session) and it makes that badge easy for them. They have to write it all up, but having been there and seen it makes it much easier. Mutt went to work with his new bars on yesterday. Won't see the pay raise for them until next paycheck, though. Well, I recon I'd better get Doug up and feed him so we can go to school. It's raining again! This time I'm complaining! Sure appreciate my cirly hair on days like this, though, because while everyone else fights stringy hair, mine just curls tighter! Thank you, you two kind people, for giving me curly hair! You're is so good to me!!  By the way, don't worry about those pictures. Mutt ordered 2 prints of each, but when he saw the price of them when he picked them up, suggested we order on print of each next time! We'll keep sending you some and then when we come and visit will bring a trailer and haul 'em back! Ha! Be good, and thanks again for the lovely rug! I told the kids that when I put it on the floor I expected them to walk around it so they wouldn't get it dirty!! They laughed at me!! Gotta run! \n",

      "Everyone is off to school, dishes are soaking (imagine that!!), we've had accordion practice this morning, and I got some ironing done while everyone was rushing around here. That's a start, anyway! Landed in LA on time at 7:53 P.M. and the whole menagerie was there to meet me. We stopped and had hamburgers and got home at 10:30 P.M. Jack was long to drive from LA to Riverside (and stop for hamburgers) as it did to fly from Denver to LA. Had a real nice trip back. As we were flying over Las Vegas the plane Captain announced \"We're flying over Las Vegas, Nevada at an altitude of 39,000 feet at a speed of 545 MPH. The temperature outside is 60 degrees below zero up here right now.\" Brrrrrr. Sure was good to get back, but they managed so well that I think I'll come back again for a couple weeks. Docegie said, \"Don't leave very soon, Mother, because we ate so many TV dinners and Potpies that I don't like them anymore.\" The house was all cleaned and they'd taken the clothes to the laundromat Saturday morning, so my ironing was waiting, but the washing was all done. The don't have neighbors like Frances has and they shifted entirely for themselves while I was gone, so I think they did real well. Uncle Sig was here about noon Sunday. He was coming Monday forenoon but Mutt had to leave here at 1:30 Sunday P.M. for Hamilton Air Force Base for a week, so Uncle Sig dropped by after he'd been to check with Malford and left at 1 P.M. as he was due back there for dinner. He wouldn't eat with us because Malford's son and family were coming to Malford's for dinner, too. He sure looked good , though. He said I looked just like Frances. Will have to write to her and see if that's \"good\" or \"bad\"! Ha! My family met me with a new Mercury Station Wagon! Sure hate to think about car payments again, but the motor was shot on that one and the crankshaft badly bent (mechanic said we must have hit something pretty bad at one time or other to bend it that bad. Must have been from the tractor collision. I almost got hit a couple times where the darned thing stalled halfway across an intersection, so guess Mutt figured a new car would be cheaper in the long run than a new wife! Ha Ha Ha. We went down to see what they did with our car after they got it and they put a rebuilt motor in it, painted it, and put a new crankshaft, a new lock on one door (that had been broken since we were in Grand Forks), repaired the upholstery several places and had it up for sale for $1200.00 They gave us $1050.00 for it, so it at least was a down payment. If we'd put another $1000 into repairs we'd still have payments on that and still have a car that by next year wouldn't be worth enough for a good down payment! It sure drives nice! The other one had over 60,000 miles on it and hasn't acted right since we tangled with the tractor! Mutt was worried every time I took that car on the freeway for fear it'd break down or stop and on the freeway that could be tragic, so we feel better about that anyway. I worked from 1:30 to 5 P.M. yesterday. Just as I was leaving, Uncle Gus came out, so I chatted a few minutes with him. He looked good. He seemed real glad to see me and I asked how you people were. I told him you sent some pictures of his kids when they were little and he grinned from ear to ear. Don‚Äôt have my suitcase unpacked yet and I work this afternoon and Wednesday P.M. and Friday P.M. and Saturday A.M. Oh well, if I need anything I know where to look, anyway. Hope you‚Äôre both resting lots and feeling good! I sure enjoyed those two weeks! It was like a tonic and the first time I‚Äôd been away from the kids and we all fared well. I fixed fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy, etc, for Sunday dinner and the kids really thought it was great! Richard was complaining of a stomach ache and had diarrhea after  breakfast Sunday morning and that bright father of his said, ‚ÄúMy gosh! One meal of your mother‚Äôs cooking and already we have one kid sick!‚Äù He ducked and headed for the other room real fast!! Lucky for him that he was leaving in a couple hours!! Didn‚Äôt want to send him out of here all black and blue so I didn‚Äôt hit him! The kids haven‚Äôt stopped talking since I got home! They should be about caught up now. All three boys made the football team, so are excited over that. Heavens to betsy. It‚Äôs 5 minutes to 10, so I‚Äôd better get moving. Be good, and hope you‚Äôre both feeling better. I‚Äôm sooooo glad I took my vacation there! Gotta run! \n",

      "8.35 A.M. and I have accomplished nothing except getting everybody fed, ironed, and mended and counted \"1-2-3-4\" for the accordion boy, so I am not doing too well today. I am still in my pip, and robe and have a cup of hot coffee sitting here. Man is that good coffee after the rush is all over! Well, Pappy, by the time this letter gets to you, your birthday will be over for another year! Did you eat lots of cake and ice cream?? I have some trick or treat candy left, if you are hungry! Did not get nearly as many kids here as we expected, so we have candy left again. Ugh!! Makes me sick to even look at it!! Dr. Kanter is off to a medical meeting in San Francisco so I do not work Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, this week! Can use the time real well. Got all my washing caught up and I have ironed and ironed and be darned if I can get caught up! Does not bother me, though! Decorated cup cakes for Doug's room yesterday and then helped serve for their Halloween party. Got three loads of wash done and folded and put away and some ironing and the dishes and made three or four \"runs\" to pick up and deliver kids, and then was keeping an eye on our next door neighbors, too. She had a new baby October 25th and from all indications had a kidney and bladder infection so took her to the emergency room at the hospital about 11 P.M. night and she is back home in bed, but feeling pretty miserable. The baby is good as gold, so that helps. Her mother was with her last night but think she was more frightened than Patsy was!! I will tell you this nurses training was the best thing I ever learned! Sure have used it a lot. (Thank you for telling me go and \"larn it!!) Our Television went on the blink Tuesday night. Kids turned it on and the smoke started pouring out of it! Mutt took it apart and has been working on it every night after he gets home and it is fixed now and we have the best picture we have had in years! He spent about $10.00 on tubes and hate to think what the labor and tubes would have cost if we had sent it out! The had \"picture\" of television stuff all over one corner of the living room and I did not dare move a thing! Frankly, I was a little leery that it would ever work again, but my better half fooled me and I am real proud of him! Of course, he had lots of experienced help leaning over him and asking questions and maybe they helped him! Ha!! Did I tell you that the Boy scouts had their Court of Honor last Thursday (October 24th)? Well, Mark got his first class rank and three boys got their \"Life\" rank, Rodney and Richard and Sibyl bay. They called the mothers up with the \"Lifers\" and we got a pin like their Life badge. The scoutmaster Nes Dudek (there are three scoutmasters in this tramp and Lewis DuPue is one) said, \"Well, I do not know how we are going to do this! Which one of you is going to pin this on your mother?\" Then he said, \"I will tell you, which one is the older?\", so Rodney pinned my pin on. Mama and Papa Jane and Fiendona Hurst were there and they were as proud of their \"york decendents!\" Now all three boys can start working toward their Eagle. That will take another year, though, I think. They can make it in 6 months, but most of them do not. Doug has started in Cub scouts so we are starting over again! Tell Cora I made that prune cake and everyone liked it, except Doug and he does not want to taste it because he cannot stand buttermilk and he is afraid it will taste buttermilk in the glaze! Mutt and Richard were really sad on it! I could sit and eat the whole thing! I did not, though! Glad to hear you are \"going easy\" and feeling better! I did not have any rush, mush, deadline here and deadline there, so I just might come again!! Do I have to make reservations for a room before I can come?? By the way, mom, ask Daddy if he knows how to make a cigarette lighter!?? He does not know?? It's simple! Just take out the tobacco!! (That came home from cub scouts) Well, I reckon I had better put on the ball and get moving. Think I will shampoo the livingroom rug! It sure needs it! Say hello to Emma and Cera and \"Mamo Dolly\", and keep well! \n",

      "I'm all by my lonesome, so may I visit with you, or are you busy? Mutt left at 10:24 A.M. from the Riverside Airport to go to Frisco and then to Colorado Springs and then to Portland Oregon and expects to be back next Saturday. The Vanderpools invited Mark and Doug to go with them to their Grandmas farm in the orange groves at the edge of Riverside, so I let them go. Then Karen and Diane decided to go bowling and Rodney and Richard and Lonny (Vanderpool) decided they'd go with the girls, so here I are!! All alone!! Lonny had to stop at their house to get some socks to wear in bowling shoes and Mark found out I was alone and called to see if I'd rather he come home so I wouldn't be all alone. I appreciated it, but knew he'd been dying to get out to that farm, too, so told him to go ahead. He really thinks it's terrible if they leave me alone. Hmmmm Maybe he thinks I'll get into some mischief or something!! The three big boys got home from Scout Camp about 7:30 last night. Guess they had a good time but took the joy out of the whole trip when we had to tell them the dog was dead! A week ago Saturday night (when Andy 9 years and John 10 1/2 years Osbrink were staying here), Mutt and John went to the ball game, Karen was out to the movies and I stayed home with Andy and Doug. I fed Peanuts about 7:30 and he was hooked securely on his chain then. About 9:30 the Humane Society called me to tell me they'd picked him up dead about 3 blocks up the street!! Someone had to have come in and let that dog off the chain, and he didn't bark so I think it must have been someone he knew. Guess we'll never know what happened! I got the kids off to Sunday School in the morning and fried a chicken and fixed a picnic lunch and planned to take the kids on a picnic. Tom Ball was here having coffee with Mutt, and then the phone rang and it was L. D. Ryan from Porterville. He and his wife were in Fullerton and would be here in about an hour. Well, we told the little boys about Peanuts when they got home and Doug cried and cried and Andy and John just turned pale and didn't know what to think! I cooked another chicken and added to the picnic lunch and when Evelyn and L. D. came, we took them to Fairmont Park here in Riverside and we had a picnic lunch and let the kids ride on the rides and playground the park for several hours and they soon forgot their tears. Peanuts had decided on his own that he was Richard's dog and whenever he was loose in the back yard he would stay right at Richard's heels. Needless to say, Richard is taking it the hardest. He's so choked up all the time, we can scarcely talk to him. Know these wounds will heal in time, but he sure loved that dog!! I went upstairs to talk to him last night and he was sobbing so hard that I had to get out of there or I'd have howled right with him. He hasn't cried in years and \"we two big people\" didn't know what to do with him! I went downstairs to fix them something to eat and sent Doug up to tell all the boys to take a cool shower and come down and eat! They got started yacking at the table and talked and talked and think they all felt better. Soon as they finished eating, Doug demonstrated the new dishwasher, and by that time it was time to send everyone to bed. Well, here's Doug and Mark and Karen and Diane. Twins and Lonny (he's 15) stopped at Vanderpools so Lonny could change into long pants and come back here for supper and then they go to Youth Fellowship at church. Richard's in better spirits now! I got a dishwasher for my birthday (early, but that's Okay), and you should see Doug! He practically grabs the plates as you take the last bite of food and heads for the dishwasher. If you want seconds, you better keep one hand on the plate or it will be gone! The novelty of that will wear off soon, I'm sure, but I'll let him keep at it as long as he will!! Tomorrow it's off to work again. Tomorrow afternoon I have to take a sleeping bag back to Norton. Mutt checked it out for Mark to use at Scout Camp as his is thinner than the twins and it has to be back tomorrow. Had to take Doug out Friday P.M. and have his little finger x-rayed. He and Larry (he's 8) Vanderpool were fooling around playing cops and robbers and somehow Doug ended up with a finger all swollen and black and blue and couldn't bend it. That's bad for an accordion player, you know! It will be a couple weeks before he can use his two small fingers on his left hand! It wasn't broken, just badly sprained. Later! Well, everyone is fed, dishes in the dishwasher, sprinkler on in the yard and it's beginning to cool off a little outside. It was supposed to hit 105 degrees today and I believe it did. Sure was a scorcher. Loline and Little John and Tina were here Thursday P.M. Johnnie is going to have plastic surgery done on his ear next week. It will take at least three surgeries and take about 2 years. They make the ear a little bit larger than the other one because the new ear won't grow. It will be alive, but won't grow after it's completed, so they have to estimate what size it will be, to match the other ear. If he'd been a girl, they wouldn't have the surgery done, but kids in school have started teasing him about his funny ear, so they decided to have it fixed up for him. He doesn't have as large an opening in his, as I have and not quite as much ear to start with. I'll keep you posted on it. It's 8 P.M. and I think I'll send a couple of these monkeys to bed. Mark is so cross and he's just plainly worn out. Will write again one of these days soon. \n",

      "I'm going to take a few minutes and write to you. This is such a wild week that I haven't had time to think! Karen is all registered and Doug registers this morning at 9:30, twins at Ramona tomorrow morning, Mark at Sierra tomorrow morning. I'm supposed to bring a dessert and service for three and attend a luncheon for Jr. Hi teachers and PTA people tomorrow at 11:30. Rod and Rich are going out for \"B\" football team as they had physicals at one time, were fitted for teeth guards at another time, got their uniforms another time, bought two pr. of football shoes yesterday (another $20 shot), have practice from 4:30 P.M to 8 P.M. so eat before and after practice, and today they go to pick up their band uniforms and I'm taking them all out to the base for haircuts, and Rod has to have a pr. of school shoes today and they have Scouts to-night, etc., etc, etc. Twins have completed all their badges now for Eagle so just have paperwork left, recommendations of minister, about 2 friends, etc. and should get it either this month or next.  I have 5 or 6 pr. of school pants with the cuffs pinned up waiting for me to something wild with them, like sew them up. Karen got a permanent yesterday so she's all beautiful now! She got elected Captain of the girls' drill team, so has been real busy getting all that taken care of because they're having new uniforms made and have had trouble getting zippers, etc. This phone stays hot! I took a week off from work because I knew it was going to be real swamped and it sure has been. Mindy and Marie and Sharon Jones (she was 17 on May 15th) came last Friday and were here until Tues. morning. Monday morning Clyde (he's 2 yrs. older than Mutt) and his daughter in law and her three little kids came for breakfast and were here all day. We had 15 people around your big old table and they were all Joneses!  Really enjoyed the day and think it was the first time Mutt, Clyde, and Windy had been to-gether in years and years!! The three of them drove up to Ontario to see Dad Jones' sister that lives there and she was so thrilled to see of \"Walt's\" boys. Windy and Marie sold their store (after 23 years there) and moved into town in Petersburg. It was the first time they'd been to visit us in 12 years and guess it was the first vacation they'd taken together since then too. We went to Knott's Berry Farm one day and and the men and boys (all but Mark and he had completed a 20 mile hike for his hiking badge in Scouts the day before and he was beat, so didn't go) went to a big league baseball game in L.A. one night. We had a busy weekend but sure enjoyed it. Lolly Sebelius Sveum's boy hiked with Mark. They spent the night here after Scouts Thurs. night and then hiked out to Rialto to Lolly's early in the morning, had a swim and a sandwich and hiked back at night. They were really tired, but still have two 10 mile hikes to go, so Lolly's going to bring Ronnie in here and then they'll hike out to her place and spend the night and then hike back the next morning. This requirement calls for two 10 mile hikes but they can't be the same day, so that's why they'll stay overnight at Lolly's. Rollie Sveum is on a survey in Alaska someplace and should be back in November. They move more than we do! She has three nice kids. I have piles of dirty clothes sorted in the hallway to wash and a pile on the spare bed to be folded and ironed and a mountain of ironing to do. I'll catch up some day! And if I don't, I'll never know the difference anyway, so why worry. Took all 5 kids to the dentist , that Dr. J.B. Ledfors, and they all came out clear again with no cavities. He had entered a golf tournament on Sunday they gave 7 trophies in each flight and he got a 7th in the second flight, so had a nice trophy sitting there. Frederick Ledfors, D.D.S. has just opened his dental office about 10 blocks down the street here. Uncle Gus had called Uncle John at home one day when Uncle John was home for lunch and demanded that he take Fritz in with him in his dental office and said Uncle John owed it to him (Uncle Gus). It made Uncle John so made that he told him he'd paid Uncle Gus back every cent he owned him and that he'd babysat for years for him, and he didn't feel he owed him a *@* thing. Uncle Gus replied \"Well, John, then go to H--- and don't ever speak to me again!\" Uncle John called the phone co. and had his phone number changed and then had Laline call me to give me the new number and it's an \"unlisted\" number so Uncle Gus can't get it. Fritz had been out and talked to Uncle John before and Uncle John had told him that just didn't want anyone in with him, because he'd tried it before and it just didn't work out, and he didn't want to end up having any hard feelings with Fritz, so they were all happy and satisfied with the decision, but evidently Uncle Gus wasn't. Funny part of it all was that one of Uncle Gus' cows had a new calf shortly after that and Uncle John wouldn't call Uncle Gus to tell him about it, but Laline said Uncle John was out there working with the calf to get it up on its feet and keeping one eye peeled to be sure Uncle Gus didn't see him doing anything for him! Think the big trouble is that Uncle Gus can't realize that Uncle John is 48 years old and is no longer his \"baby\" brother but a grown man now. We see Uncle John and Laline all the time, but never see Uncle Gus. I'm uncomfortable around Uncle Gus, anyway, but good ol' Uncle John is just as comfortable as an old shoe. Just decided not to have any more birthdays! I get so far behind in correspondence when I get letters from everyone at once! Sure enjoy the letters, though, and everyone else is rushing just like we are at this time of year, so they'll understand when they don't hear from me until after school starts. Well, have you two decided to spend the winter with us? Got two new pillows and a new bedspread in that bedroom downstairs so it looks purdy and it sleep purdy good and it'd look lots better if it were occupied by my ma and pa!! Free rent, too, at this place, and and free food and entertainment!! Holy Smokes! It's 8 A.M., time to get some kids up and at 'em. I'm picking up one of Doug's buddies and his buddy's mother when we go register. They hope they can get in the same room as Larry is the only one Doug will know at this school. Gotta run! Enjoyed talking to you. Still hope to call one night.  P.S. Would you stick the pictures in an envelope next time you think about it? or save em till we come or till you come see us? Thanks!  \n",

      "Mutt just left for work, everyone is fed and kids are up getting ready for school and I washed and curled my hair yesterday so it isn't even under the drier this time. Had planned to write this weekend, but Dr. Kanter was out of town and I had the day off, so got the washer started and the iron going and kept right at it. (Ha! and washed more, ironing than I got ironed so doesn't look like I did a thing!) Yes, Sibyl and Louis are separated. Divorce becomes final in January. I didn't say anything because I kept hoping things would straighten out and I didn't want to be the one that spread the word! That's the news that greeted me when I got back from N. Dak. last October. They got their interlocutory degree in Jan. and final takes one year. Remember me telling you that they'd bought a house close to where we were living last fall? Well, they didn't take the house, but it was the real estate fellow that showed Sibyl houses and got that house for them, that she is running around with now. He was seeing Sibyl even before the interlocutory degree was through. He is such a bold, brazen fellow and he filed for divorce from him wife the same time Sibyl filed for hers. He's a retired A.F. Capt. and I can't stand him. She doesn't call me anymore and I never see her, because she wanted to bring \"Pete\" (Guy Peterson) over here, even before she had her interlocutory degree, so Mutt could meet him because she \"hoped\" they'd be good friends, (he worked in A.D.C. and Mutt knows some of the fellows who worked with Pete when he was still in service). Anyway, I told her as nicely as I could that I thought it would be better not to bring Pete here under the circumstances, as it would take a lot of explaining to the kids (and besides I think Mutt would have thrown him out!) She got quite huffy and feelings have been \"cool\" between us ever since. I'd love to see her, but have no desire to see \"Pete\", so don't go over there at all. Her folks are furious at her and think it's terrible! Even her mother says Sibyl is wrong! Gene gets so mad when he starts to even mention Pete that he just turns white! Pete is pulling the boys away from Louis, too, by buying them things. Louis was here for supper last night and he was so upset. He said he and Sib had always agreed that they didn't want the kids to have motorcycles and had bought Sonny an old car that ran good and was good transportation. Last week Pete bought Sonny a $200.00 motorcycle, against Sibyl's and Louis' advice and of course, Sonny thinks this is great. Sonny is a freshman in college this year and was such a nice kid when the family was living together, but he has started smoking now, and doesn't have much respect for either Sib or Louis now. He came over to see the boys a couple weeks ago and stayed an hour or more and seemed to enjoy it so much. The twins wanted to help him get the rest of his badges so he could get his Eagle award with the twins (they all got their \"Life\" awards at the same time) and they know how much it meant to Louis, but Sonny never finished it and the twins go before the board to-night. Neither Sonny nor Mike go to Scouts very often anymore and I know it hurts Louis! Will hurt him more, I know, when he has to present Rodney and Richard their Eagle and Sonny won't be there to get his.  He's still so in love with Sibyl that he almost cries every time he mentions her name. That Pete has fed her such a line that she's convinced he's marvelous! I don't know, maybe it will all work out for the best, but it sure is a mess right now. Louis moved into a small hotel on the same side of town where they lived before and he gets Mike on weekends. Sibyl is so bitter at the whole world! Think I'll call her and try one more time to see if maybe we could have lunch together someplace some noon. I just won't go to her house because Pete buys her groceries at the Commissary (which is illegal in the first place) and then in town she has to get lunch and supper for him. Maybe he won't let her have lunch with me, but it's worth a try. Enough of that subject. Say, Mom, you should be here and take this cake decorating course I'm taking now! We made the cutest marshmallow dolls and dressed them with royal icing. This Thursday we make a sheet cake, frost it light green and then we bring our dolls and when we get through it will be a \"Garden Party\" cake. Sounds cute, doesn't it? I sure enjoy fooling with that stuff. The Pyracantha (sp?) berries are all turning orange and red and our yard is full of them and so pretty now. Roses are still blooming and we just picked some persimmons off the tree. Jiminy Crickets! Why didn't you tell me the clock rolled around to 8 A.M.???!! Gotta fix Doug's lunch and then get me self dressed and out of here to work. Could gab all day but better not. By the way, that spare bedroom is ready anytime! I had wall to wall ironing in there until Saturday buy now it's just in one pile!! Sure would love to have you here for the winger!! Gotta run!! \n",

      "I looked in the mirror this morning, scared myself half to death, so now I have my hair all rolled up and I'm hooked up to the hair dryer again. Good way to get letters written anyway! Kids are about ready for school. Mutt worked from 6:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. yesterday and then went back about 10:30 last night and will work until some time this afternoon. The twins have a football game at 3 this afternoon, so I know he won't come home and sleep and miss their game! Then there's a big Ramona High football game at San Bernardino tonight and we can't miss that because both teams are undefeated and we have to go \"root\" for Ramona High you know!! Had a teacher's conference with Doug's teacher yesterday afternoon. You have 2 conferences and 2 report card periods in Calif. in Elementary grades. Pretty good idea. The teacher gives you a report of grades, etc. when you have the conference anyway and you get to meet the teacher that way. Only complaint she had about Doug was sloppy handwriting, so he got a \"C\" in that. Also gave us the report of the national SCAT tests they gave and he came up with a 94%, so guess he will do alright. Your package came and it was just like Christmas! Must be mental telepathy someplace, because the seat of my p.j.s had just split out and I didn't know it showed all the way to N. Dak!!! I read all the Knox news in the papers, too. I want to show Doug's den mother the \"lip wiper\" and the \"net sponge\" as she might like it for a Christmas project. Haven't hung my Kennedy plate yet, but have the spot all picked out. Am wearing my white nylons today. Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you! Doug is out of school today because of teacher's conferences, so he is spending the morning at his buddy's house. He was going to work with Mutt, but when Mutt had to go in at 11:30 last night, we changed plans!! I have a dental appointment today at 2P0M. with good John Ledfors! Jus a 6 mos. Check-up so don't think he will find anything cuz nothing hurts! He just had an abscessed tooth himself a couple weeks ago and had it pulled and the blamed thing wouldn't stop bleeding, but he said it's O.K. now. Little Johnnie goes in the hospital next week for his big surgery on his ear. I sure feel for him! They're a little anxious this time because he will have to stay in Community hospital for a couple weeks this time. He's never been away from home overnight before, so they're wondering how he's going to take that. Little Johnnie looks just like Big Johnnie! Last time they had him in for surgery, they operated in the morning and he came home that same day. The twins have to leave at 7 A.M. from Romona in the (Sat) a.m. for a trip to UCLA, to the UCLA Air Force football game. There are 28 bands performing, in a joint act of some sort, at half-time for the game, so they have to be at UCLA early for practice and then go on to the game and will be back here about 5 P.M. They always check in every so often for clean clothes and I shake hands with them and introduce myself \"Hello, I'm your Mother,\" and they still recognize me, so it's not a total loss. Yesterday morning in cake decorating class, we made a wedding cake ornament. Turned out pretty nice, but now I'd like to try some other and use my imagination. I'm sure having fun with this stuff. Made bluebirds and doves, too, but mine looked more like blobs with wings!! Will have to work on them a bit. Boy, I'm really going to have to clean house this weekend! Usually accomplish something Thurs. P.M.'s but sure didn't yesterday. Can't tell the light colored furniture from the dark colored furniture. Oh well, maybe it looks better this way. It all matches anyway! Took Karen downtown and got her a pr. of black \"heels\" and a pr. of tennis shoes for school yesterday. She and Rodney are horribly hard on shoes. We got Rod and Rich a pr. of French Shriner shoes (Sept 10 and paid $15.00 a pr. in the Bx (the sell for $24++ in the stores here) thinking they might last longer and Rodney's have to be half-soled already!! Think we'll stick to a cheaper shoe, because they just don't last anyway. Rich isn't so hard on his. The tops of their shoes look like new because they keep them polished, but sure can't feature how they can go through the soles so fast! Well, 'Tis 8:20 and I'd better get combed and dressed and off to work. Thanks again for everything in the pkg.! I put the gum and candy in the middle of the dining room table and noticed it disappeared like magic! Must run! Much love to you both!  \n",

      "Welllllll, you should be home, according to the letter we got yesterday forwarded from Riverside. Had a letter from Frances just before we left Riverside saying your blood sugar had jumped to 396 Mom? Ye gots! Guess we didn't fee you right! Nex time we won't make any fudge or divinity or sweet stuff. It's not as tempting when its out of sight. The boys still talk about all Grandma's grand baking, though, especially the donuts! They were \"the greatest\" you know! We left Riverside about 7:30 Wednesday night and got in here at 4 a.m. Got a motel in Santa Rosa and slept till after nine and then watched T.V. while Mutt took the car to the garage (a spark plug and wire). Stopped and had breakfast about noon and then came to the house. Water man came about 1 P.M. and the gas and electric about 4 P.M. so we were in business again! Had blankets and pillows and sleeping bags in the car so we \"rolled out\" on the living room floor (carpeted) and slept that night. The van was here at 8:15 a.m. and had everything unloaded and much of it put away by 1 P.M. That is, the necessary things like pots n' pans and dishes and towels, were put away. We went out and had hamburgers for lunch and later in the evening drove over the the high school to a basketball game. It was a reall good game and Mutt talked to a teacher from another school, and when Mutt told him we'd come from Riverside, he asked if we knew Coach Stokesbery. Mutt didn't know him, but the boys did. He was one of their B team football coaches last year. We looked in our phone directory when we got home and he's teaching at Forestville. It isn't even a toll call, so the boys are itching to get the phone in so they can call him. We're to get a phone Monday. Last Sunday we had dinner with Uncle John and Loline. When we got out there, Uncle Gus and Fritz had just finished patching up the garage. It sill has several pretty big holes and is badly cracked all over and worthless if it rains, but i is standing. A lawyer evidently told them they couldn't do these things. By the way, Mom, while I was there Loline and I walked up to a neighbor's house, and a lady visiting from Michigan was making a toothbrush rug, and showed me how to do it again. I've had one started since we were in Albuquerqueerque in 1951 and it came back to me right away when she showed me again. Monday night we had supper with Mama Gene's. Lolly and kids were there, too. Talk about a meal!! She had everything on that table. Papa Gene said the reason it was so good was because he peeled the potatoes! Tuesday night we had supper at Karen's apartment. She and Karen Jacobson fried chicken and it was real good. Karen was home Wednesday P.M. for about 15 minutes and then we stopped by on our way out of town to say \"Sayonara\" and she was alone in her apartment. (One girl had a date and the other was working.) She looked so \"all alone\" and hated to leave her, but had to. Sure miss her around here. I'm completely outnumbered with all these \"male companions.\" Oh, by the way, I sent a box of your stuff and things Railway Express but sent it to Mongers because I didn't know when you were going home. Tell Pat I'm sorry I didn't get Doug's parka cleaned befoe I put it in there, but sent it anyway, because it's still practically new. Even the dirt is new!! Ha! Real California dirt, and not even checked by the Department of Agriculture when it cross the state border! She doesn't know what a bargain she got! Ha Ha Ha! Went to the commissary this morning (in the pouring rain) and guess what I found!!! Maple Nut Ice Cream!!! Now I know we'll like it here! The hillsides here are beautiful! All rolling hills with lots of trees and everything green, and farms all over the hillside. Driving in this little city is treacherous, though. Streets go every which way and they're narrow. We could really fix up fenders here, Mom! Must sign this off. We have to go buy curtain rods! Have a whole bunch of them and none are long enough, or rather wide enough. Oh well, whatever it is, they don't fit!! That's what I was trying to say. Boys don't mind living like sardines, but asking them to be goldfish in an aquarium, they think is too much!! Keep us posted,  Mom, and you and Daddy stay healthy! You both seemed so well while you were in Riverside in the sunshine! Gotta go! \n",

      "Are you feeling better today? Really felt that this could have been avoided, but makes me all the more approve of Dr. Kanter's theory \"Either I see you once a month to see how you're doing or I can't be your Dr. because I have to know what condition my patients are in if they're my patients and I'm to have any piece of mind that I\"m keeping them in good health.\" We didn't watch your diet as we should have, Mom, either, buttttt, no use looking at what's behind us. Thing to do now is watch diet and have regular checkups. Sure you agree with the latter, esp!! You seemed to feel so good when you were at our house, but the sugar probably hadn't reached the saturation point till you got to Washington, and then blooey!! Too much!! Wellllllll, I have curtains up at all the windows, so we're no longer in an aquarium. Still have boxes in the kitchen and 1/2 a garage full, but all the good china will have to stay packed because there's no place to put it! No linen storage space, either. This being \"just a housewife\" will take a little getting used to, too. Darn but this place is empty!! Miss that daughter of mine, too!! There's an accordion teacher here in town, too. Name is \"Guido Boccaleoni.\" Doug says, \"Mother, do you suppose I could call him just Mr. B?\" His first lesson is Monday at 5:30, so we shall see how it goes. Doug's kinda lost interest since he was away from it so long when Mrs. Airey was sick, so hope we can get him interested again. He has an awful lot of homework here. He's spent at least 2 hours on math every night since we've gotten here. He doesn't have trouble with it, it's just that there's so much of it to do. Mark got his desk stained and varnished before we left Riverside and he's so proud of that! Really uses it, too, and it looks so nice in his room. All the boys seem content with the school change. Wrestling coach with especially pleased with them. They went to a tournament in Santa Rosa yesterday afternoon. Rod and Mark wrestled varsity and he had Rich wrestle J.V. (but has him on the varsity roster now for the tournament (7 schools) next Saturday). Rod won his match (decision, Richard pinned his man the first period, and Mark lost his 2-0, but didn't feel too badly because he wrestled an undefeated senior. The Varsity made nine points (3 were Rod's) and Junior Varsity made 10 points (5 were Richard's) so coach was well pleased with the Jones boys. Rod said his was the 7th match and the first one from Petaluma to win his match. Richard's opponent was 6'2\" and when they shook hands after the match, he said to Richard, \"You're just too strong for me.\" Richard said he was dumbfounded because it was like wrestling \"a bunch of light sticks.\" He said it was the easiest match he ever had. He thinks maybe he looked so mean that he \"psyched him out\" before they got started. Have never seen Richard look mean, but maybe he can if he tries hard! Mutt went back to work Wednesday morning, so his vacation is over. He made several trips o Hamilton and I'm not at all sure I'd like to try it by myself for awhile! Never saw such a maze of roads, over, under, across, one-way, do not enter, stop, proceed with caution!! Ye gots!! Have an excellent Commissary, though, after and if you get there! Stopped for a few minutes at Dr. K's office during lunch hour the day (Wednesday) we left there and Dorothy said Uncle Gus had stopped in there Tuesday to see if we had gone yet. I sent them (Uncle Gus) a letter from here. They cut our phone and electricity off before 9am. Wednesday so couldn't call anyone and we didn't have time to roam around and see everyone the night we left. Say, does that new bedspread look nice on our bed!! It hangs so beautifully, too! I have white and gold curtains in there (had them in the living room in Grand Forks) and it looks right decent! Now the living room is quite a different story!!! Bright olive green wall to wall rug, turquoise living room set and that wine recliner, ooooh, It screams every time I look in there! Bought some plain light beige drapes and that helps some, but ugh!! What a combination!! Well, life never gets dull around here, anyway. Monotonous?? Well, occasionally maybe, but never dull!! Scouting is real active here, so boys will be getting back in that, maybe by next week. Louise and Gail are writing every day and notice that the boys take mail to the mailbox every morning too. Gail sent all the sports clippings out of the Riverside Press, so we were all sitting here last night reading up on Riverside sports. Well, me dear Mither, it's 10:30 and suppose I'd better go get dressed! Take care of yourself and get yourself in shape so you can come see this part of the country next time!! It's 400 miles closer, anyway. \n",

      "Have three big boys bustling around here, and Doug crawled in our bed, under the electric blanket to get his feet warm. I‚Äôll sit here in the sunshine and visit with you a while. Aha. They‚Äôre off and running, three boys gone to the bus stop. Karen is coming home a week from tomorrow so we‚Äôre getting all excited here. Seems like she‚Äôs been gone a hundred years! Mutt spent a week at Norton (March 20-26) so he saw her twice. They went out to dinner one evening, so they are about ‚Äútalked out‚Äù but the boys and I are sure anxious to see her! She will only be here from Fri. to Tues. because she has to be back to be at work at Woolworth‚Äôs on Wed. Our boys have next week off for spring vacation so they‚Äôll be in school again the Monday and Tuesday she‚Äôs home, so they‚Äôll have to talk fast on Saturday. Easter Sunday we‚Äôre supposed to go to Tompkins house for dinner. I‚Äôm to let her know today. Mutt came home with a nice surprise yesterday. He was a awarded the ‚ÄúCommendation‚Äù medal for his exceptional duty while at Norton. It was awarded to one Colonel and to one other CWO, so we‚Äôre real proud of our Daddy. Here‚Äôs what the citation that accompanied the award read: ‚ÄúWarrant Office Francis E. Jones distinguished himself by meritorious service in the performance of duty as Office-in-Charge of SAGE Systems training, Los Angeles Air Defense Sector from 16 November 1964 to 28 December 1965. Mr. Jones‚Äô unswerving determination, diligence, and efforts to achieve an optimum operational capability were significant factors in the Sector‚Äôs attainment of a high degree of Air Defense readiness. His broad background, tactical cognizance, adherence to safety standards, and his ability to detect and correct procedural errors, have ben inestimable value to the Los Angeles Air Defense Sector. The distinctive accomplishments of Mr. Jones reflect credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.‚Äù These come from Wash. D.C. and are signed by Sec of Air Force and by Maj. Gen. Carroll McColpin. Anyway, we‚Äôre real proud of him and know he earned it. Had to stop and listen to Doug practice his accordion and now he‚Äôs gone, too, so I‚Äôs all alone. Have to go downtown and pick up Mark‚Äôs shoes today. He didn‚Äôt particularly like wearing tennis shoes to school, but had to have new heels put on his, and I promised him I‚Äôd pick them up today. How‚Äôs the weather up that way? It‚Äôs been just beautiful here. I‚Äôve acquired a Cub Scout den so we had our meeting in the back yard yesterday. I ran around town and got cigar boxes, dirt, and grass seed and we are making cigar box gardens. One boy is going to have his green grass be pasture and he‚Äôs going to have a farm. Another one said his was going to be a Japanese tea garden, so I‚Äôm anxious to see what they come up with. I have eight boys (none of them mine) but I sure enjoy them. Doug is in Webelos now and Richard is helping with them. Rodney and Richard still get mail almost every day from Riverside. Gail (Richard‚Äôs girl) called last week all excited to tell us she‚Äôd gotten her letter of acceptance from Mercy Hospital in San Diego. She was so afraid she wouldn‚Äôt make it and so thrilled when she did. Still have Margie‚Äôs birthday card here and I bought it when I bought yours and Uncle John‚Äôs mom. Boy, am I on the ball! Speaking of ball, Doug got a call that he made a Little League baseball team and she‚Äôs so excited you can‚Äôt touch him with a 10 foot pole! They haven‚Äôt had a first practice yet, but he‚Äôs sure rarin‚Äô to go. He practices his accordion faithfully every morning so in case they call during the day, he will be ready for practice. The accordion has to come first and he knows it. Did I tell you that all three of our boys got a varsity letter here in wrestling? Well, about a week after they got their Varsity letter here, they got a Jr. Varsity letter each in the mail from Coach Hocking at Romona High in Riverside. Mark really got a kick out of that! His first year wrestling and got both a Jr. Varsity and Varsity letter!! Twins are both out for track. They had a meet yesterday and Rod got 2nd in broadjump (and didn‚Äôt know he was even going to enter that because he‚Äôs never done any broadjumping and coach asked him to just try because they didn‚Äôt have anyone for that) so Rod went over and tried, beat the school record and got second. Coach sure was pleased. Guess Rod came in 5th in the 200. Rich and Rod were both on a relay team and they came in 1st. Rich ran 180 yd hurdles and came in 3rd. He couldn‚Äôt run or practice last week because he hit a hurdle in the meet before and gouged up both knees and one hand pretty bad and he‚Äôs a little shy of the hurdles. Still has a little trouble bending his knees, too, because they‚Äôre still oozing, so has to keep them bandaged, and that happened 2 wks. ago, but you know how slow those things heal. He was so disgusted with himself because he was about 6 inches behind the guy in first place and had really been gaining steadily and I think he‚Äôd have won it, if he hadn‚Äôt taken that sprawl. He got up and jumped the last hurdle anyway, and got 4th at that! Well, it‚Äôs 10 A.M. and I‚Äôve stopped and had coffee, and I stopped and yakked on the phone about the Cub Scout Scoutarama that‚Äôs coming up this Saturday and, and, and, and, and, and, you know how it goes! Hope the sun is shining and the birds are singing and that you‚Äôre out walking around the yard watching all the plants pop their noses through the ground! I have spring fever, but this adobe soil is really something to work with! We‚Äôll probably move on base by June, anyway, so I‚Äôm not going to do any wild digging this time. Mutt drove by ‚Äúour‚Äù house in Riverside and said the yard is a mess again. Made him sick, after all the work he put in it to keep it in shape. Gotta go take a shower, go work Cub Scout stuff, etc. Happy Easter!! \n",

      "Still have 4 boys in the bed! How lazy can they get! It is their vacation, though, and there's not much of anything for them to do. The lady (Margaret Dupont) next door called Mark last night and he went over and she gave him over 100 comic books, so maybe they're in there reading! She has only one daughter (same age as Karen) and the daughter (Goldie) left for Reno yesterday to get married. Margaret is an R.N., but also a bookkepper and works at the hospital here as bookkepper. Her husband left for Okinawa for 120 days TDY (temporary duty) the first of Feb. and yesterday she got a letter that his orders were changed to PCS (Permanent Change of stations) so she came right over here to tell us. They own the house next door and she just didn't know what to do. She gets so lonesome over there and when she asked me what I'd do under those circumstances, I didn't hesitate a second to say, \"Rent the house and head for Okinowa.\" Took her about five minutes to think it over and decide that's what she was going to do, too. If her husband stays there alone, it's an 18 months tour, and if she goes it will be a 36 month tour, but 18 months would be awfully long with her daughter gone now, too. We may end up a with a little Pomeranian dog, too! It's Goldie's dog and she can't have pets in the apartment they rented, and both Goldie and the dog like Mark, so Margaret it trying to talk Mutt into letting Mark have \"Ginger\". She's a cute little dog and has had \"surgery\" and she's house broken, so I wouldn't mind. Tomorrow we have two birthdays here, so will bake a couple cakes tomorrow morning. Going to bake them in a ham can and decorate them like Easter Eggs, put them both on one board and write \"Happy Birthday to a couple of good Eggs\" on it 7 put the candles around the edge of the board. It has to be different you know! All my cake decorating stuff is packed, but I found an old plunger-type metal one I've never tried to use, but think I can work it enough for a single cake. Karen gets into San Francisco at 9 A.M. Sunday and are we getting anxious!! Been 2 ¬Ω months since we've seen her and that's a long time! Course Mutt saw her in March, but the boys and I haven't seen her since January. Got the Tribune yesterday and there was that Sandra Drege's picture! She's a  cute girl and looks so nice in her cap and uniform! Know how proud Helen and Lester must be of her. It's a beautiful, beautiful day! Sun is shining, birds are singing, and just looks like one of those days that makes you feel good all over! Gonna take the boys downtown and get the twins each a new pr. of pants for their birthday. Went out to the Px yesterday, but they didn't have any to fit them. Boys and I went out to the base about 10 a.m. and nosed around the BX till 11:30 then Mutt met us at the BX and took the three big boys to the gym to play handball all afternoon, Dough and I went grocery shopping and came home. Doug had baseball practice at 4 P.M. These \"older\" men are supposed to take one afternoon a week for P.E., so it worked out fine. Course Mutt had been at work since 5:30 a.m., so put in almost a full day, anyway. You should hear the B.S. fly when they get home!! It was just \"luck\" that this guy beat that one, etc, etc, etc. They're all full of baloney, including the biggest one!! Think I'll put an ad in the paper to see if I can get a job \"office nursing\". Have to be here at mealtime, since my \"extra help\" deserted me and stayed in Riverside and haven't had the boys do much in the line of kitchen cooking. They survive on campouts without me, so I'm sure they'd survive here, too, but I'd much rather work days. Doug is in school from 9-4 and is at the bus stop at 8:30 A.M. and gets home at 4:30 so I could just as well be working and bring in a little of that green stuff. Everything is a little more expensive here than it was in Riverside. Got our gas and elec. Bill yesterday and it was a gay $35.31. Almost dropped the bill when I took it out of the envelope. Richard and Rodney each got a pkg. from Riverside yesterday. Gail p it in a pkg. for Doug, Too, and it was a \"See's Candies\" Easter egg! Did he ever feel important! Well, my dear Mither and Father I must press my dress and take these boys shopping for trousers! You have a Happy Easter and we'll be thinking about you! Hope you're having some of this beautiful spring weather because it makes you feel good, good, good!! \n",

      "And how are mine fine Pa Pa' and Mama' today?? 100% on the mend I hope! Got this card Sunday at the drug store, and intended to write and mail it Monday, but I've been in a state of shock ever since Monday. Monday morning I decided to wash my hair, take a shower and then write while I had my head under the drier. Wellllll, just got my head lathered up and somebody rang the doorbell. Peeked carefully out a window and saw it was a Salvation Army man passing out their paper bags, so ignored the door and went back to the bathroom. Well, decided I had all day so I leisurely finished shampooing my hair, took a shower and just got all my clothes on except shoes and got my hair rolled and the doorbell ran again. Looked out and saw the Salvation Army truck in the street and thought \"Boy those people don't give up!\" Opened the door and here was a Salvation Army paper back stuck in the door and this man said, \"Hello, Mrs. Jones\" and it kinda dumbfounded me that he knew my name. The he said, \"I have some people out here you might know.\" Looked out there and couldn't believe my eyes!! Ed Crook was getting out of the car! It was next best to seeing you two! They just stayed for coffee and were headed north to Richland, Washington. The \"man at the door\" was Jim Crook! They both (Jim and Ed) looked so good and it was sooooo good to see them. I didn't even know they were out this way but gosh it was good to see them and it was so nice of them to take the time to stop! I really appreciated it! Then Mutt came home Monday night from work and said \"Housing called and the # 1 man on the list turned the house down because he doesn't want to move till June and we're next on so we can have it if we want it.\" Wellllll, we looked at it yesterday and we're moving Monday! It's a nice big 4 bedroom duplex. It's all on one floor and same housing as Major's and Lt. Col's house. Doug will have to change schools again and he doesn't even care! Twins and Mark will drive the opel the 15 miles to school each day to Petaluma until school is out. They're all eager to get on base because of the gym and the swimming pool and the cheaper movie prices. Mutt can walk to work and Doug can walk to school, so they're all eager! Frankly, I'll be glad to make the move because we should be settled for a little while then. Four bedrooms are hard to get and we decided we'd better take this one quick. We only pay $130.00 on base, with no utilities to pay except phone. Here we pay $140.00 and utilities are high here so should be about $50.00 a month cheaper on base. 'Course we just paid the $140.00 rent May 1st and had the last months rent paid in advance so that's $150.00 and we got a $20.00 cleaning deposit so the landlord has $300.00 of our money for rent for this month and he has disappeared someplace. Couldn't reach him by phone, \"disconnected and no listing at all\"  phone co. says, so Mutt stopped by his house and there's someone else in there, and neighbors didn't know where he'd gone, so can't tell him we're moving! He'll get that amount back in 6 months in what we save by living on base so figure we're ahead in the long run. Four bedroom houses don't move very fast and sometimes it's 6 months before one becomes vacant so it was either take this one or gamble on waiting 2 years for the next one so I think we're doing the right thing! Our next door neighbor here said that the gas and electric on this house runs over $50.00 a month in the winter, so that sorta helped us decide to quickly take this base housing. Besides, we'll have a bedroom for Karen if she decides she wants to come home sometime, or for company, but most of all, for the ironing board!! Oh, and address will be 201 Westover Circle Hamilton Air Force Base., California 94935 Zip code is the same as before except to reverse the last two numbers. Bet I'll goof that up a few times. Well, I've rattle on and on and listened to accordion music all the while, so suppose I'd better sign this off and start \"sorting\" again. Have magazines stacked high again and stuff and junk to sort and throw out, etc., etc., etc. Doesn't seem possible we could have accumulated anything in 3 months, but it's here! Hope this finds you puffing on your pipe, Daddy, and getting easier by the day. Then we'll know you're better. Watch that Pat though. She's probably still after that $6.00 in your pants pocket! Just know you'll feel better Mom when the weather gets warmer and  you can get out in the sunshine. After reading of the snow (in Monday's P.C. Tribune) it doesn't look like spring is quite there yet, though. Must be just around the corner someplace, though. Much, much love to you both from the bravelingest, moveinest people you have! \n",

      "Surely this bright pretty day will find you both feeling better! Was so glad to hear that Daddy was home and that Mrs. Schaam was there to help you, and then I hear mom is back in the hospital! Darn it all! you people just cannot win up in that country! Spring is here, and things will get better, I am just sure they will! It is such a beautiful, beautiful day and I could just as well be at the hoop with mom or at the house with Daddy and I here I am, just sitting. Doug had his first ball game out here last night and what a game! They are a \"form\" team and started at 6 P.M., only played 5 innings and had to quit at 8 P.M. with a score of 16-15. Think there were something like 3 or 4 hits and the rest were \"walks\" or an occasional \"hit batter\". They are really fun to watch because they do the darnedest things! Doug had accordion lessons in Petaluma at 5 P.M. today, so he and I are going to leave at 3.00 when he gets out of school and go visit Doris Tomkiman another warrant officer's wife who is still living in Petaluma.  She is the nicest person and we had coffee together at least 4 or 5 times a week when we were both in Petaluma, so I miss her. Mailman just came by and left a letter for Richard from Gail and a card from the Pierce county Tribune saying they would like some more money or I will not get the Tribune and you know, I gotta have the Tribune. We have been having a real ball with Rodney this week. There is this cute oriental (boys say she is Korean descent but definitely oriental) girl who has had her eye on Rodney ever since we got to Petaluma. Well, she is a lovely girl, a daughter of a retired army Major/sergeant and is cute as can be. Saturday night Rodney had a date to take her to the drive-in movie in Petaluma. Richard rode to Petaluma with him and stopped off at Wade Stearns house and he and I went to the same drive in movie. They (Rich and Wade) were going to park right behind the couch, but Betty Wong's old boyfriend got there first, so Rich and Wade parked nearby and in a spot where they would have to walk by Rod and Betty every time they went to the refreshment stand! Guess they really gave him a bad time, when that darned Mark!! He goes around here singing \"sa-ker-ra\" (a Japanese song the kids all sang in Japan) and when we say something to him he says \"Ah so, ah so\" and drove from the waist three times like the Japanese did! He was not home Saturday night because he spent the night with a buddy and they went out alone hunting Sunday morning. Last night we had abalone for supper and Mark looked at it and said \"very fine food, very fine food.\" Rodney looked like he would love to slug him, but Mark sits there looking at the abalone so serious and rubbing his stomach with his hand and saying \"very fine food\" and not even looking at Rodney, so you know he was not talking to Rodney. Of course Mutt sits here chuckling like crazy and enjoying every bit of it. Rodney looked at Mark with looks that could kill and then looked at his father sitting here chuckling so hard that his shoulders were just shaking and first thing you know Rodney was laughing too. What a crazy bunch!! I have thought so often \"thank heavens I had an Irish father and learned to take teasing\", because I married one just like him and the teasing is going right on to the boys now. Sergeant Symmonds was here for supper Saturday night. His family is still in San Bernandino and their twin boys graduate from High School this year, so he feels right at home here. He offered to go with Rodney in case he needed a chaperone, but Rodney did not take him up on the offer. Do not know what nationality Symmonds is, but he is a fiery redhead. He is as full of B.S. as Mutt is anyway! Guess that is why they have always gotten along so well. Well, I reckon if I am going to goof off this afternoon, I had better get dressed and get something done around here. Mutt comes home for lunch now and it is so nice to see him pop in and break the day in half! If I keep feeding him the leftovers, though, he may decide to eat elsewhere! Sure cleans out the refrigerator, though! Really hope this finds you home again, mom, and both of you feeling better! Pat has been a jewel about writing, and I am so grateful to her. Much, much love to you both and keep up your hope and faith!\n",

      "Well, are you getting some of your strength back? It always leaves a lot faster than it returns, but I feel sure you'll get those legs working again. I left there feeling real secure and relieved, because I know you are in the very best hands there and you were looking more like your old self. She left at 10P.M. Saturday night, Mutt and the boys had everything packed when I got off the train at 4:45p.m. Got in here at midnight Sunday night, called Karen Monday morning and she and Dianne got to San Francisco at 7:10p.m., Karen was so relieved when I called her and told her to see if she could get reservations and fly home. She had been sick for a week and Doctor Kanter wanted to put her in the hospital and she convinced him she was able to make the trip up here. She lost 13 pounds last week (which didn't hurt her because she'd gotten up to 138 pounds), but she couldn't keep anything down. Mutt and I fixed bacon and eggs and biscuits and gravy for the boys yesterday morning and Karen ate a biscuit and gravy and kept that down! Of all the things to eat, I was sure that was the least apt to be retained, but she fooled us. Took her to the doctor yesterday morning, and this morning I took her to the lab. She might have Hepatitis along with her mononucleosis. Sure looks miserable, anyway, but so relieved to be home. She's still running a fever of 102 degrees, and if she doesn't start improving or if the lab tests show Hepatitis they'll hospitalize her here. Loline took her to Ontario to the airport, bless her heart! Karen said Doctor Kanter was so good to her and wouldn't take any money from her. He was seeing her every day, too. Must get a letter off to him, too. Loline is leaving for Girl Scout camp for 3 weeks. She's going to be camp nurse and they let her take Johnnie with her. Tina goes, too, because she's a Brownie Scout now. Our neighbors across the street saw our car in the driveway Monday morning and Hazel came down with a hot coffeecake for our breakfast! Thought that was real nice of her! Our boys really enjoyed this trip to North Dakota, They never knew that cousins could be so much fun! Hazel brought their portable TV down here for Karen, and Shelt and Mutt hooked that up. Only trouble with that is that I found Richard, Mark, Doug, and Dianne all in there watching TV last night, instead of turning ours on in the living room. I ran them out, because if Karen has Hepatitis, too, they'd better steer clear of her for awhile. We all had so much to tell Karen that it was awfully hard to let her go to sleep the night she got home! We're doing a little better now. She looks so yellow, but don't know if it's from dehydration or what. Mutt went back to work this morning. Found a note on his desk from a Marine Colonel Watts that we knew at Norton. The note read: \"Dear Frank, Sorry I missed you. I'm on my way to Vietnam where the good days go\", and then left news of several other fellows that had been with Mutt at Norton, too. Guess I'd better get the vacuum and the dust cloth busy and go through this place. Haven't had time to touch it since I got home, and that's 3 weeks of dust piled up! Greet Mrs. Sundet for me and thank her again for being so extra good to my mother! \n",

      "Gosh, it's sure quiet around here! Mutt just left for work and the boys are all sleeping. We took Karen to San Francisco yesterday and she was to get in Ontario at 5:30 p.m. and good ol' Uncle John was going to meet her in Ontario. Sure missed her last night! big Boys and Mutt went to a North South football game, and Doug and I stayed home. Doug was so tickled to get back in his own room that he cleaned his dresser drawers, and set up his microscope and looked at slides for about an hour. He said he wrote you a letter, too, so I'll have to see that it gets mailed. Uncle Gus should be there by now. They had quite a trip ahead of them. Twins start on their third job of cleaning vacant quarters today. The last one was a lulu! They finished that yesterday and got $70.00 for 4 boys, Mark and a buddy had to help them and they worked from 730 in the morning until eleven at night for two days and then it didn't pass first inspections, so they were back over there ain at 7:30 yesterday morning and worked till 230 p.m. Richard worked on the stove alone for 9 hours! Had \"Easy Off\" on the oven 5 times to get that clean and finally had to take a small chisel to get some of it off. They're really gaining a healthy respect for housework and nobody puts a hand on the wall around here or one of them grins and says, \"Hands off the wall! We may have to clean them someday!\" I like it! I like it!! Now they can say it instead of me! People back of us moved out yesterday, and two families across the street are leaving today, so we'll have all new neighbors again. All three families are retiring, too. Went to a coffer at the wives club and met two women we knew in Japan. Had talked to one a few minutes when she stopped by one evening, but the other one didn't even know we were here, so she was really surprised. Guess when we've run around this A.7. as long as we have we'll always run into someone we know. Sure keeps life interesting, though. It's always so fascinating to hear where their \"little kids\" are going to college or where they live now! Life sure moves fast. Karen had a big date Wednesday night. She will probably write and tell you about it because she had a letter started to you before she left. This young Naval Academy Cadet has been home on 30 day leave and met the boys and Mutt at the handball court. One day the boys showed John a picture of Karen adn he liked what he saw. Every day he payed handball, and every day he said, \"How's your sister doing now?\" and \"When am I going to get to meet her?\" Last Sunday night Karen and Diane and the boys went to the movie here on base and John came in the theater and saw the boys and came over to sit with them. Karen said it was so obvious and the boys all moved over for him so he could sit with them, next to Karen of course! Now the boys and Diane all claim that John missed most of the movie because he was so busy talking to Karen. Anyway, they went to dinner in San Farncisco and went dancing after dinner Wednesday night and had such a good time! He drank orange juice and she drank coke!! They'd dance one dance and then he'd insist they sit out the next three or four, because he was afraid she'd get too tired and he didn't want to be the cause of her getting a relapse! He called yesterday to see if she'd gone. He talked about 10 minutes, and said he had really had a nice evening and just hoped Karen didn't get too tired. Well, here's one of those big moving vans across the street. Glad I don't have anyplace I have to go today, because it's so hard to get out of our driveway anyway, and with two moving vans out there!!! Well, it's a good day to stay home. I'd better go get dressed and wash and curl my hair so I'll be beautiful on my birthday. Ha!! Better color it, too, as my age is beginning to show again! The boys informed me yesterday that I needed my youth renewed because the gray was shining through again! Their cleaning buddy, Alex, was standing here and of course they're all taller than I am! So they said, \"Right, Alex?? Don't you think she's going to show her age tomorrow if she doesn't hit the bottle again?\" And Alex says, \"Right\"! Darn crazy boys, but how dull it would be without them. Must run! Running out of paper anyway. Much, much love to you and Daddy.\n",

      "Well, is it a good day, Mom? Looks real purdy out this way! Boys (twins) are across the street cleaning Major Ormerod's quarters, Mark is still sawing logs, Doug is working at his paperwork for his accordion lesson, Mutt is long gone to work, and I have the washer going, and dishes soaking. We've had a little excitement here. Kept smelling gas outside our bedroom window and Mutt called it in and by golly there was a gas leak alright! They dug down and found a hole bigger than the size of a dime in the elbow of the pipe and then found the pipe cracked about 3 feet farther, so replaced that, and this morning there are more bubbles coming, so guess they'll have to dig up more of Mutt's pretty lawn. Had to shut off the gas on 42 quarters all day Saturday and then they found another leak down the street around the other corner from us and Colonel Ellington said it looked like they were going to have to replace the whole gas line. None of the gas lines that they've uncovered have had any insulation on them at all, so it looks like another shoddy job pulled off on the government. Course I had invited Ormerods over for supper that night because the van had just loaded up their furniture, so we just lit the grill and had hamburgers and everything else cold. With all the gas shut off there were grills going all over the place! 3 big boys were gone all weekend. Not gone very far, just down to a barracks on base. The Protestant Youth of the Chapel had a conference this weekend and the PYOC from Travis A.F.B. were their guests. The chaplain got a barracks and they had the girls upstairs and the boys downstairs. They had nine adult chaperones and there were 36 kids there. They ate at the mess hall and the kids from Hamilton provided the program. The chaplain had gotten some people from \"Teen Crusades\" in San Francisco, to talk to the group. They're young people in late twenties or early thirties who have been dope addicts or criminals, etc., and tell the kids the horrors of this type of life. These people have been cured, supposedly, and they really make an impression on the teenagers. (Scares the heck out of them especially along the \"dope\" line.) They had a good weekend, anyway, and it was so quiet here yesterday with just Mutt, Doug, and I here that it was just awful!! I get to go to the dentist tomorrow. Boys are all through and this dentist is awfully rough and Doug didn't appreciate him a bit! He's saving his money now so he can fly to Riverside to Uncle John the next time he needs to go to a dentist!! Twins just flew in to change their clothes and go to Terra Linda for a counceling appointment and then back to clean the duplex. Only takes a few minutes at the High School. Just have to be sure they're schedule is all set for this school term. Football practice starts today, but they will have to miss practice for a couple days because they had this cleaning job lined up. This one is a $50.00 job. They'll be so rich they won't know what to do with all their money!! They're going to buy their school clothes and that will make a big hole in their billfolds! Well, the maestro has his accordian out and I'm listening to \"O Holy Night.\" Not bad, not bad! Mark just came out looking for cereal and now that everyone is up and yakking, it's time for me to quit and get busy.\n",

      "Well, there goes #4 son out the door to school. Now I should get to work. Everything needs something done to it today, but don't know where to start, so I'll talk to you and think about what should be done. That ought to help! Have three washerfuls of clean clothes on top the drier, dishes in the sink, floors are dirty, furniture is dusty and you know what I'd like to do?? Finish up that Christmas wall hanging that Margie got for me in Fargo! Have it almost finished and it's just like a fever! I'm dying to get it finished and would much rather do that pretty stuff than wash dirty dishes. Mutt is in Phoenix. Richard and I took him to South San Francisco to the International Airport Sunday morning at 6 a.m. so we beat the birds up that day! Twins are all excited as they both made first string Varsity in football. They have their first game this Friday. Mark didn't go out for football because he has a pretty heavy schedule of solids this year. He's working hard to get enough badges to get his \"Eagle\" in Scouting. He's joined an Indian dance team and brought me the material to make his Indian costume. \"Don't have to have it till the 23rd, Mother.\" I'm an awfully pokey sewer, so don't know if he will have it by then or not, but probably will. You know how mothers are! They usually manage to find time for what has to be done. He's been using someone else's costume, but needs his own, and he paid $7.00 out of his own money for the material, so imagine I'll have it ready for him. I've been busy at the dentist and I'm not through yet! Spent two solid hours there yesterday. Have three teeth ready for gold crowns next week. Can't chew on these temporary caps and am really appreciating teeth right about now. Get so hungry for meat and can't chew it yet. You know how that goes! By the way, did you ever get your teeth back in, Mom? Gosh, but they're nice things if they don't hurt you! Handy little gadgets, too! It's a little chilly outside but the sun is shining so no doubt it will be another nice day. Karen called Sunday night and she's doing just fine. Says she's resting lots, and feeling just great. Thank you so much for the birthday card. Made me feel good just to see your handwriting on it, Mom! Hope my Daddy is feeling better, too. Am sure he's more content at home. I still plan to go to work, if I can find the time! Seems like there's so much to do that I never have that extra time. Have to be here for breakfast and supper and haven't found any jobs with school hours. Boys appreciate having a hot meal on the table when they come home from football at 6:30 or 6:45. Come to think of it, I think they like food any time, or all the time. Richard had a letter from Gail. She's at Mercy Hospital in San Diego and just loves it so far. Gets to come home every weekend her first year of training. They start right out on the floors and she was so excited over that. They didn't get the new school finished up on base so it's a big mixup and will be for the next 6 weeks. Doug goes the regular hours 9-3:20, but they have three 6th grade classes (over 100 kids) in the multipurpose room of the old school and 3 teachers teaching in there. They have some on split schedules in rooms on the main part of the base and some bussed to neighboring school. Talked to Martha Freeman (they were in Riverside with us) and she has kids leaving at 8, 8:30, 9, 9:30 and 12:30 and coming in one at a time all afternoon till after 5:00. Says it's a mite confusing! Their oldest boy is going to Riverside City College this year. Welllllll, I knew I'd get caught!! It never fails! Just had company and I'm not even dressed yet! Guess I'd better get dressed and get at this place. I'll clean it up and then nobody will come! Does it ever fail?? Mutt called from Phoenix yesterday p.m. Said it had been pouring rain and flooding and there was only one road open into Phoenix then. Told him he ought to get out of that wet climate and come up here where it's dry! (Guess it rains from October to March here almost everyday!) Gotta get going! Enjoyed talking to you. Would enjoy it more if I could look at you too, but can't do that, so will just \"talk on paper.\" \n",

      "Don't know if I'm coming or going but must stop and chat with you!  First off, we want you to be the first to know that Karen and Jim are getting married. Haven't set the date for sure, but think March sometime. She wants to get married in Riverside and this long-distance planning has me bumfoozled, (Help, Helen!! Help!! You must know all the answers now.) She wants a church wedding and I talked to her yesterday, so she's to check the base chapel at March and the Officer Club for the reception, and check with Reverend Ashrink at the Magnolia Presbyterian Church and then we'll see which she decides on. 400 miles is a long ways to plan a wedding. She's coming home next week for a couple days so we can shop for her wedding gown and order the invitations, etc. Then I plan to make one trip down there before the wedding. What confusion! Suppose I'll have to see about having the reception catered since we're this far away. Hmmmm, see?? I'm just thinking out loud to you. Time out: Mutt just called and I had to run the car down for the safety check, so that's done. Uncle Carl and Nancy (and Greta, the dachshund) were here Thursday and Friday. They got here about 7 p.m. Thursday but had gotten a motel and unloaded the car before they got here, so they wouldn't bother us. They stayed until 11:45 and came back for breakfast the next day. Mutt had gone to Seattle the day before so at 1 a.m. he tapped on the window and said, \"Betty, will you let me in? I don't have my key.\" Sooooo I let him in! Wasn't that nice of me?! He went to work at 7 a.m. then when Uncle Carl and Nancy came for breakfast, I called him and he came back home and stayed till 12:30 and they left about 1 p.m. Sure glad they came back for breakfast or they'd have missed Mutt.You should have seen Tina and Greta! They really had a ball. Uncle Carl was telling how \"Greta\" would sit on Daddy's lap when you were there. Saturday the twins wrote \"S.A.T.\" and achievement tests from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Said their brains had never been so tired as they were by 5:30! Yesterday Bob and Lois Booth and 7 year old daughter were here for dinner and supper. They were with us in Las Cruces and he and Mutt coached a Little League team when boys were in 2nd and 3rd grades and he couldn't believe these \"men\" were those little boys he knew then. Mutt came home for lunch today and said, \"Guess what?? I'm going TDY again tomorrow!\". Mygosh! He'd been home all weekend! Just going for a couple days and this time it's Castle Air Force Base, near Merled, California. I hurried right in and put his dirty shits in the washer! Now I'm listening to Doug's accordian lesson in Novats. Sure glad I have \"left over\" turkey for supper! Guess what I'm doing Wednesday P.M.s from 7-9 P.M.!! Doris Tompkins and I started typing class last week and man, are we good! Typewriters they gave us can't spell very well but we're good! Har! Har! Had a catastrophe to day. Put the coffee pot lid in the dishwasher and the little glass gadget in the lid came out and fell in the fan gadget at the bottom and I had chewed up glass on everything! Had to empty all the dishes in the sink, dip out the H2O with a cup, mop up the last of the water with old rags (didn't dare wring them out, they were so full of glas bits!) and then vacuum out the glass bits. What a mess! Mailman brought a letter from Pat, saying our Daddy is in the hospital again. What a year has been for you both! Doug's lesson is about over so will sign off and get this in the mail. Had three batches of coffee drinkers this morning and they were all old \"CWO\" wives! Must run! Tell Helen I'd love to hear what all you do to get a daughter married off!\n",

      "Have my head under the drier, so will use these minutes. Karen and Jim called yesterday P.M. and Karen is coming into San Francisco at 10:00P.M. tonight and goes back Wednesday night. We're going to plan a wedding in 2 days!! Asked her if they'd set a definite date yet and she giggled and said, \"Didn't you get my letter?\" and I said, \"No\" and she said, \"We sent it registered mail, so you should get it tomorrow then, so you'll have to wait till you get the letter.?\" She said it contained too much to tell over the phone and pay long distance charges for it. I sure pulled a good one though! I answered the phone and said, \"Mrs. Jones.\" and a man's voice said, \"Mrs. Jones? My future mother-in-law?\" And I said so bright \"Oh, is this Jim?\" You know, like it might be Tom, Dick, Harry or Charley, like as if I didn't know whose future mother-in-law I was!! (Alright, Pat, you sit down right now and quit laughing!! You know I'm the brightest sister you have!) Anyway, tomorrow Karen and I are going shopping! We really had the rain here yesterday and day before. One house on base got flooded and they used a boat to get some of their personal possessions out. It was right by a little creek that runs through the base and it just went up and over the bank. Had 4-5 feet of water in that house. We have a foot of water under the house again but none in the house. Could use some on these floors, but not the variety of water that went in that house! That must be some mess! and hardwood floors throughout these places! Rod is running for Senior class president. They change every 6 months and the elections are Wednesday. This has been a poster weekend! He had his counseling appointment Friday and he has a 3.82 average and as I think I told you before, is #5 in a class of 490+ Seniors. Rich has an appointment this weekend sometime. His average is only 3.4 so he's about 49th in line. Still top 10% but his 2 weeks in the hospital didn't help him any! Specially in Physics and Trigonometry. he still expects a \"B\" in them, but just \"barely\" if he gets it at all. Sure hope these boys get into one of the academies. The State College and Universities aren't taking applications for any Freshmen or Sophomores until Reagan's tuition and budget plans get set up. 'Course that means the city colleges will be bursting at the seams and many kids won't get into college at all. Reagan wants to cut the college budgets way down and impose a $400.00 a year tuition at University and $200 at State colleges. Way it stands now, though, you can't get in even if you have the money, because if their budget is cut, the student load will have to be too, so they just won't accept any more students. The Navy Academy football coach talked real encouraging to the boys and gave them more papers to fill out, and gave them the impression that they'd both get in there if they submitted the papers. Never realized there could be so much paperwork and then still possibly not make it. Saturday P.M. the boys and Mutt went to the gym and played handball. First time Rich has played since he had surgery. It didn't hurt his knee but was he sore every place and yesterday morning! Decided he'd definitely gotten out of shape. Last night Rich worked at the officers club from 5P.M-10:30 and his Dr. was there for dinner. He told Dr. Digiglia that he'd played handball Saturday and didn't hurt his knee at all. Dr. Digiglia said, \"and did you beat your Dad?\" and Rich said, \"No, Sir.\" and Dr. said, \"no, and I bet you won't either!\" He's a young fellow, early 30's and a handball player too. These boys keep trying but they can't beat their dad yet. He's pretty good for an old 47 year old kid! Aha - Here's the mailman. Well, kids want to get married March 4th, vacation time at the phone co. is already signed up full from April to September, so she can get married before April 1st or wait till after September. She'll really have to do some rushing and mad planning tomorrow! Must get busy at the dirty house as I know I won't do any housework the next couple days! (Gee, wait till Pat gets started with all her daughters! She's really in for it!) Hope you're both feeling better. Oh, just got a long, long letter from Helen. Yegats! Think after reading that, I'm ready for Karen to elope!! Ha! \n",

      "A terrible thing has happened at our house! Your big old table with 8 leaves, is sitting here, square, with room for all of us around it! Richard came out this morning and looked at it and said, \"Say, that looks kind of sad, doesn't it?\" Rod left San Francisco at 10:45 AM yesterday and right about now should be getting a short, short crew cut. He gets to come home for Christmas, but that's six months away. Mark comes home on Sunday, I think, so that will help, and then Rich leaves in September. You know what?? Our chickens are sprouting their wing feathers and flying the coop!! I retired from my job Saturday. There's a big investigation in the wind in regard to patients money (Social Security checks) coming in there and the patients never getting them and the State Department of health was in to check it over and the kitchen is filthy, and I really mean filthy, diarrhea popping up with all the patients, etc., etc. When I asked for things like disinfectant and alcohol, etc. I couldn't get it. Needles were washed in water only by the aides and wrapped and autoclaved and there were red spots appearing around sites of needle injections and she wouldn't hear of the disposable needles and syringes, so I put in my two week notice and quit Saturday. Could use the extra money, my gosh!! Am afraid to jeopardize my license and I really think this is going to blow up into a legal thing and I sure don't want to get in the middle of anything like that. I held out as long as I could, for the patient's sake, but six Registered Nurses that came to work after I started are all gone now, for the same reason and she has only 2 Registered Nurses left on the day shift now, new ones. The owners better wise up and get that administration out of there and bring the cleanliness up to standard or they'll be shut down completely by the State Health Department. It's a lovely new building, only about a year old and could be so nice. I sure rolled it around and around in my head, but when I found out the State was getting into the picture, I decided to get out. One of the nurses that left talked to a lawyer and there was some question about us being licensed and being aware of conditions existing and to stay there knowing this, we could possibly be brought into any suit that was filed sooooo there wasn't much choice. I sure enjoyed the people, and had good aides, buttttt too risky to fool with it. Mailman just brought a letter from Mark. He said he'd passed all inspections 100 percent so far, but also said he was lonely! It's his first experience being alone for a couple weeks, so I suppose he is lonely. Said they'd gotten rained on every lunch and supper since they got there, but \"I have to admit I'm learning a lot and having some fun!\" Every Scout Camp they've gone on before his had Rich and Rod along or been with his troop, but he's the only Explorer they sent from the base. He knew the three younger Scouts they sent from here, but they're in a different part of the camp because Mark is in the \"Junior Leader Training\" part. Suppose Donita is back from her Girl's State trip, too. Know how enriching those 4H conservation camps I went on were, so kids really are lucky to get these trips. Richard just left for Terra Linda. He signed up for a summer weight lifting program from 10-12 AM noon, Wednesday and Friday. Mark will join him when he gets home. Rich worked from 5 A.M. to 1 A.M. at the Officer's Club last night, and works again tonight, so that helps his time and his pocketbook, too. He finally got his official notice of acceptance to San Diego State so he feels better. Mutt has been on leave for several days, but goes back Wednesday. He's at the gym playing handball now and Doug is out delivering daily bulletins for a little boy that's away on vacation. Just Tina and I here! Must get the washer going. Have dirty clothes a mile high and ironing, say now, I'll never run out of that! Was so pleased when Pat wrote that you were up where you could see out the window and down main street when they rolled your bed up! It's so nice to see something when they roll your bed up! Gosh, I really must get moving! It's 10:15 A.M. and I'm still in my pajamas. Tell Patty Pistrissa I'll write, now that I'm retired again. \n",

      "It's a beautiful day! Look out your window. Is it beautiful there, too? Yup, I knew it was! Rich and Mark got home from work (Officer's Club) at 12:45 AM and were back at work at 8:00 this morning. There' a big swim meet here today and tomorrow at the officer's pool (Napa, San Francisco, and whole Bay Area). They have 1900 entries so I'm sure the place will be jammed. The club has the refreshments to take care of for that, and then the boys go to the dining room from 4:30 PM till around 1 AM again so they'll be pooped when they get home. Doug is still sleeping. He leaves at 5:30 AM tomorrow for Boy Scout Camp at Crescent Lake, Oregon (halfway between Medford and Eugene, but farther inland in highway 99) for two weeks. His buddy from across the street is going, too. It's his first trip away from home for any length of time, but right now he's all \"hopped up\" to go. He needed a summer uniform so I proceeded to cut down one that the twins and Mark had worn when they went into Scouts at his age. Wellllll, I took them in over two inches in the waist and seat and practically remade the whole pair of pants. He's still wearing size 10 walking shorts (even if he will be 12 next month) but is growing taller. He's 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 75 pounds and doesn't look thin. Wears size 12 shirts, but just doesn't have any waist and behind to hold his britches up! Karen called a couple nights ago. They moved into a smaller apartment right by the college. (Cheaper, too, $85 instead of $125 a month). Jim is working. Doctor didn't want him to go to work yet, but she said he couldn't stand it any longer. His ankle is still swollen but he keeps it wrapped. He's driving a glass company truck out of LA and is gone from Monday to Friday. They're putting his check in the bank and then he's going back to school full time this fall. He called from San Lorenzo one day and you might know, I was at the commissary, but Doug talked to him. Karen is coming up here for a week before school starts (Jim's last week on the road) and then he will finish his job, come up here for a few days and they'll fly home again. Rod called Sunday. They let them call home that day. Some sort of special privilege. He tried out for the Academy Church Choir and he made it! Said they took 93 \"4th classmen\" (that's him). There are 1035 in his class, so he feels he was real lucky to make it. Haven't heard from him since Sunday but they were to go out on bivouac Monday for three weeks so suppose we won't hear for awhile. He says it's rough but he still likes it. He's planning on Rich making it next year. Rich is all registered, etc. at College of Marin here and will stay home and commute to school. Took the Civic Service exam again for the Air Force Academy so all the paperwork starts over again. He's sure determined he's going to make it this time! Works with weights three days a week and thinks his knee is getting quite a bit stronger. Mutt is in Portland (or Corvallis) and will be home the 27th. He thinks his August trip is going to be canceled and that will suit us both fine! He was supposed to be gone August 2 to 22 and what with Doug gone and the boys working… egads!! Oh, well, there's still Tina! Went over to the Convalescent Hospital to pick up my check the other evening, and talked to a nurse on 3-11 shift. She said that the place had been crawling with inspection teams and the roof was about to blow off something. Sure glad I got out of there when I did. Doug was with me and we stopped to visit several of the patients and they were so thrilled I stopped. The patients are nice and aren't aware of the crooked stuff going on in the office or the investigations, etc, but are aware that the help doesn't stay long and they wonder why. It's a lovely new building and could be so nice! I enjoyed the patients so much, miss the job, but sure don't want to get involved in a legal entanglement. Reckon I'd better get moving! See the mop and bucket sitting right here where I left it when the boys came in with buddies for lunch, just as I finished mopping the kitchen floor! The mop and bucket never got any farther and the dining area never got mopped! Here comes that lazy Doug looking for breakfast! He and I are going to try to get in to see Doctor Zhivago at the theater this afternoon. Runs from 2:45 to 6:30 so is a long movie. I rarely go to a movie. Think I've been twice and we've been in this house 14 months, but we decided we'd like to see this so we'll give it a try. Must go feed the starving man!\n",

      "I've been a piker about writing but think things might get back to normal now.  Mutt left at 8 am yesterday and will be back the 12th.  This trip is to Portland, Oregon and Fallon, Nevada.  Then he leaves again the 1th and will be back the 22nd.  He goes to Phoenix, Arizona the first part of February, but I haven't marked the calendar that far ahead yet, so don't know just when he leaves on that trip.  Rod left yesterday morning, too and the rest of the boys went back to school yesterday.  Guess what!!! It's horribly quiet here!  Rod's girl, Cathy, was here to see Rod off, so I kept her here to have lunch with me and then took her home about 3 P.M.  She goes back to nursing school Sunday night.  Got a letter from Karen yesterday so know they got home okay.  It's an 8 hour drive, but took them 11 hours.  They were very fortunate, though, because they were held up 2 hours because of a 30 car pile up just ahead of them, so their guardian angel must have been looking over their shoulders because they could so easily have been two minutes earlier and been in the mess instead of just tied up in traffic waiting.  We really had a nice Christmas  We had our Christmas dinner on Sunday December 24th and Winnie and Emory Dawson (Winnie is Mutt's cousin) were here for dinner.  They left about 5:30 and then we all went to the candlelight ceremony at the chapel at 7 P.M.  Emory is 68 and not feeling too well, so they didn't stay to go to the candlelight ceremony with us.  I went to work the 26th and Karen and Jim left shortly after I did (6:30 am) I guess.  Rod sure looks good and is he full of zip!  That must come with being physically fit.  He is so happy and content and enjoys the Academy and was real happy to be home, but didn't mind going back, either.  He's number one in his squadron militarily, so will be on the \"Commendent's list\" and will get a wreath to wear on his uniform (they call the wreath their \"toilet seat\"!).  He also thinks he's on the dean's list, depending on his last test grade) and if so will get a start to wear inside the \"toilet seat\".  The Academy sends us a transcript of their grades and he said we should get that in a week or so and the we'd know if he made the Dean's list.  Very few \"squats\" (4th classmen) make the Dean's list, so we're anxious to see hos he does.  He went to church here Sunday (I worked) and they were having a retirement ceremony for Chaplain Scholten (Episcopalian) and he met Rod at the door of the chapel and asked him if he'd do the honor of carrying the church flag for his retirement ceremony, so, of course, Rod did.  Then several times during his sermon he was talking about the new and the old of service men and a couple of times he said, \"Isn't that right Rod?\" and Rod said everyone turned and looked at him and he said he was beginning to get a little embarrassed.  I was sorry I missed it, but I did have 5 days off at X-mas couldn't take the rest of the days, too.  Rich is so excited!  He got a letter from Tony Clausen last Saturday telling him to reserve January 13 and 14 for an interview in Santa Rosa, so he knows he's in the top 40 in competition for the Academy this year.  They had turned him down before this time last year so he's sure hoping!  I don't know about whether Clausen has received the results of Rich's physical yet or not, but it wasn't mentioned, so I don't know what the score is n that.  You should have seen Rich when he read that letter, though!  He was sitting on the floor watching a football game (with Rod and Mark and Mutt) and he slugged Rod in the shoulder and almost knocked him over and said, \"Boy, you go back to that Academy and tell those squats that this year the Academy is selecting MEN!!\"  We took some pictures, so when we get them I'll send you some.  I have to go to the commissary this morning because I sure let the cupboard get low, and besides I cook differently when there's just 4 f us here.  Mark and Rich both work tonight so there'll be just Doug and I here tonight.  If I ask Doug what he'd like, he'd say \"chicken pot pie!\"  He sure enjoys those!  I'll bet he gets just that for supper.  The boys eat at the club because they charge them for one meal, anyway, so they might as well eat it.  Mark worked New Years Eve.  Started at 6:30 P.M.  They served breakfast at 12:30 A.M. and counted 410 tickets afterwards and Mark said he knew some ate without turning in their tickets, so he got home in time for me to fix breakfast for him when I got up at 5:30 to go to work.  He was hungry because they only had two boys to handle all those people and clean up the tables afterwards and when they got through and went to the kitchen to eat, the cooks had locked up all the food and had gone home, so the kids didn't get to eat.  It was nice to have company for breakfast, anyway.  Just as we finished eating, we thought we heard Mutt moving around back there, so Mark said, \"Quick, Mother! I'll sing 'How Dry I Am' and stumble down the hall to my room and you hang onto me and see what Dad says when he comes out in the hall!\"  Well, we did it and Mutt just looked back at me and said, \"Who do you two think you're kidding?\" and just grinned!  Guess Mark and I need \"drama instruction\" or something!  Guess our \"acting\" will never get us an \"Oscar\" either!  Darn! and we thought we were so good!!  Thank you for the check, too, Mom.  Rod and Rich took theirs and took the girls and drove into San Francisco to Golden Gate Park and rented \"bicycles built for tow\" and bicycled through the park.  It was a beautiful day and they had a wonderful time, but Rich came home pooped!  He's not \"in shape\" like Rod and Rod kept him puffing all the while they were here and we all tormented Rich and he didn't seem to care.  Well, Mom, I've rattled on and on again, but now that I've chatted with you I can get to work again.  Oh, by the way, my little \"Grandma Ledfors\" is doing fine.  Can't stand on her feet yet and she's convinced it's her \"Scandinavian rock bottom\" that just seems so heavy it just wears here legs out trying to hold it up!\"  She is so cute!  She is eating better in the past couple days so maybe that will make her legs stronger and her \"rock bottom\" seem lighter!  Must get bus!  Hope and pray that 1968 will be an extra good year Mom, and if prayers will do it, it will be a good year! \n",

      "Everyone out the door, so it's time for a quiet cup o' coffee, a chat with you, and then I gotta get dressed and get moving. I started to clean Doug's room and closet yesterday. What a mess! Plan to go through the whole place, bit by bit, but never get very far before I have to stop. Absolutely have to go to the commissary too. Mutt called from Phoenix, Arizona at 5:55 this morning (on the hot line) just to check in and see how everything was here. Rod called Sunday afternoon. He had his second wisdom tooth cut out Friday morning and it was still bleeding. Said he went back Saturday a.m. and they gave him more gauze squares to bite on, but it didn't seem to help. He passed out in the chair when they finally yanked this one out. I knew he'd have a lot of trouble, because I saw the x-rays, and they were both in there sideways, hooked under the crown of the next tooth, so they had to take some jaw bone out to get the teeth out. I told him he could blame his Dad for that because \"My Mama and I don't have wisdom teeth, so it's not us that gave you these nuisances.\" Doug doesn't have any sign of wisdom teeth and not tooth buds show on x-ray either, so guess he's \"ours\", Mom! Rick's x-rays are identical to Rod's, so he's not anticipating his session which is sure to catch up with him eventually. Don't know about Mark and Karen. I think it was real nice of you not to give me any wisdom teeth, anyway. You were so thoughtful!! Mark and 5 other kids (3 Colonel's daughters and 2 other boys) went to the beach a Bodega Bay yesterday (school holiday) and they had a good time. Tim drove his car; the girls brought the food, and Mark furnished the football and the tent halves. They stake a tent half up across the beach to keep the sand out of the food, because it's really windy over there. Anyway, Mark was puttin up the first stake and a ranger came over and grinned and said \"State law says you have to have two sides of a tent open on the beach.\" Mark said he grinned back and said, \"Yes, Sir, we're just putting up one side for a windbreak. No hanky panky here Sir,\" and the ranger laughed. Later Mark was running on the beach and stubbed his little toe on an old log and just nicely took the whole pad off the tip of the little toe, so the ranger fixed that up for him and told him to be sure and see a doctor when he got home. We cleaned it up good when he got home and I redressed it this morning and it looks fine! Just has a flat tipped toe now, that's all! He couldn't wear his shoe this morning, bu Rick has some new slippers he bought to wear when he waited tables at the officer's club when they took his toenail off and he couldn't get his shoe on, so Mark left with one slipper and one shoe this morning. Saturday we (Matt and I) sat at a wrestling tournament all day. Mark won his first three matches, but lost the 4th so came in second in Marin County, 133# class, of course he'd liked to have had the championship, but didn't get it. He still goes on the the \"next step up\" tournament, \"North Coast, I think it is, in either Oakland or Hayward. 1st two places go. The Air Force Academy Choir is singing here at Hamilton Chapel next Sunday at the 11 a.m. service and I work that day! Rod isn't with this group. The 4th classmen don't get to travel with the choirs until they have completed the 1st year at the Academy, but next year he will go all over with them. I'd sure like to hear them, anyway. Doug and I are going to a Scout dinner tonight. Darned Mark has his Eagle earned except for his appointment with the badge councilors and do you suppose he can find time for that?? Nope! Know his time is crowded with wrestling after school and working at the club several night a week, but I'd sure like to see him get it. Three of his buddies are getting their Eagles tonight and Mark should, but like I say, he's a busy boy. Rick only has class till ten this morning, so he planned to cut the grass today, but it looks like rain. It was such a beautiful spring day yesterday, so I opened all the windows and let the spring air through. This morning I shut them all again, because there's a skunk out there someplace today and the spring air just isn't the same! Suppose I'd better get moving or I won't ge anything done again. It's horribly quiet around here, though. I'll have to turn som noise of some sort on, or I won't be able to work! By the way, tell Donita I read in the Tribune yesterday where she made \"all state\" band. Congrats to her! I'm proud of her! Gotta go! \n",

      "The sun is shining and it's another pretty day. The boys are all sleeping. Mark got back from his ski trip last night and is so sun-tanned (or rather snow-tanned) and he had a great time! One boy sprained an ankle and came home on crutches - one dislocated his thumb, and one cut his wrist (accidentally) and Mark fixed them all up and came home in good shape! He was exhausted but had so much fun that he was just beaming! He couldn't get over seeing the \"old men\" and \"little kids\" slaloming down the hills like nothing. He said he spent a good part of his first trips down the slopes leaving three trails instead of two and almost froze his seat off because he spent so much time dragging it through the snow! He's ready to go back again anytime! I should be doing something, but I don't know where to start! I'll end up packing a bunch of unnecessaries with me again on this move. I do that every move, it seems, but I never know what we'll need at the next place. I just discovered, too, that I have to find some chairs for the dining room table! - Sold our others when we left Petaluma and checked out chairs from base supply here, so now we'll have nothing to sit on! 9:15 am. 3 starving boys came out here and looked so pathetic that I fixed 'em some bacon and eggs and toast and orange juice and now they are all happy and contented. Now I'll put them to work! Ha! Mark is out trimming the edge of the lawn. He's a pretty good worker when you get him started and usually does a pretty good job. I'm afraid Rich isn't at the peak of his ambition right now. Don't know if he's lazy, tired or what, but he's sure been irritable lately. I'm sure he will relax when he finds out the verdict from the AF Academy and that won't be long now. He's done real well in college - only 85 made the dean's list (3.5 or above) and he was one of them (with a 3.62) so can't complain on that, but he's awfully hard to live with disposition-wise right now and this isn't natural for him. We've disagreed on so many things lately that the atmosphere has been real tense and I've avoided conversation with him to avoid any more arguments. Yesterday I came home from shopping and there was a beautiful Easter Lily plant on the nightstand with a lovely Easter Card for Mother and he'd written, \"I know we don't always agree on things, but I love you for caring. Love, Rich.\" What do you do with 'em, Mom? Keep 'em and love 'em??? Am sure this tension will all evaporate when he hears from the Academy and knows how to plan from here on in. If he doesn't get into the Academy he will have trouble getting into a lot of colleges because it's so late in the year but at least he'd know where to start applying and could get the ball rolling. Here he comes now. He just took Mutt's sports coat to the tailors so they can alter it. Poor pa isn't the chubby rascal he was when he bought it and he will need it when he retires and become a civilian. There are so many things that have to be done. We all have to have our pictures taken and our base passes changed to \"retired\" status and that takes several pages of paperwork for each one of us, but Mutt does that. Oh, by the way. Would the hospital let Doug bring his accordion up and play a couple tunes for you? If so, we'll bring it along. If not, we'll leave it home. Guess I'd better sign this off. I keep getting interrupted with the kids or the phone and I'll be here all day at this rate. Have a Happy Easter, Mom, and we'll see you soon.\n",

      "Rich and Doug and Mutt gone and Mark about to head out and then it's all peace and quiet. The dishes are resting in the sink and the dirty clothes are going round and round in the washer, and there are dirty clothes a mile high in the bathroom. Maybe if I leave them there long enough the boys will outgrow them and then I won't have to wash them! Yesterday after Church, Mutt, Doug and I decided to go for a ride, so we just turned off on a side road and drove! Didn't know where we were going, but drove through some beautiful cattle country! The rolling green hills with trees all over and little creeks running through it and cattle scattered all through the area, 'twas really pretty. Then we went past a lake, with people fishing all around it, no trees, just a lake out in the middle of \"nothing land\".  Looked so peaceful. Then we drove a little farther and drove through redwoods, and through a couple little towns (like York, or smaller) and ended up at Point Reyes and first thign we knew we were on Highway #1., Oh gots!!, Nothing but hairpin turns and sharp ups and downs and no way to get off it!, By the time we got back on the Freeway the other side of San Rafel, my stomach was going up and down and round and round and I was green! Felt fine an hour after I'd gotten some food in my stomach and quit going round and round and up and down. Yuk!, Sure started out to be a nice drive, but didn't end u that way. Just turned the TV on and it says there's a big snowstorm in Salt Lake City, expecting to spread to Eastern North Dakota by evening, Brrrrrrr, Maybe we'd better bring our long johns with us when we come! Karen and Jim sure would like to come with us to North Dakota, but can't afford to take the time off if Jim is going to school again next fall. I'll write and ask them again, anyway. Really think you should meet Karen's Jimmie! They're sure happy, and guess that's all that matters right now. Karen goes to school one night a week, taking another Math course (she's had 4 years of High School math and one year of College math, plus Business Math in College, so don't know what Math course she's taking now, but I'll guess that she must like math!) Jim has one night course, too. The classes are just so jammed that even full time students can't get the classes they want without taking some night classes. California state law requires so many units of Physical Education, so Rich has \"Badminton\" from 7:00 to 9:00 P.M. on Monday nights. This way he has all his labs and hard courses during the day when he's more alert. Guess I should get dressed and get moving. Doug's accordion teacher gave him some music and Doug can get it copied for 10¬¢ a sheet (I think), anyway, I'm to take it to San Rafael to some \"copy company\" that the teacher said would copy it. It's the teacher's own arrangements. He gives Doug his last lesson next week. Sure hate to see him leave. He's so good!, a little Italian man, but his wife passed away a couple weeks ago, so he sold the studio and is going to live with one of his children. He has a concert Accordionist taking over, so Doug will have another teacher for a couple months and then we move and get another teacher. Mr. Taffi can really get the music out of Doug and his accordion and we sure hate to lose him. Doug thins so much of him, too, and will work like blazes for him, which he didn't do for the lady teacher he had. The washer just shut off, so I'd better get that \"loaded\" again and get moving. Hear tell you're running around in the wheelchair!! Good! Pat sounded so tickled in her letter telling about it! Gotta go! \n",

      "I'm under the drier again and there wasn't a pen handy so decided to grab a pencil and chat with you while I dry. I have a dental appointment at 10 and have errands to run all over the place. I cleaned out my closet yesterday and found 4 wool skirts that have been \"hanging\" waiting to be shortened. Took them to the tailor on base and they wanted $3.50 for each skirt, so I guess you know I brought them right back home again! I'll do it myself when I retire in Santa Monica! You know it just dawned on me that I think Marvin Myhre is working for SDC (some company Mutt is going to work for!). I have their \"Granada Hills\" address, if they're still there. Will have to check with Leona while I'm there in Rugby. I moved Doug in with Rich last night so I can use Doug's bedroom for packing and sorting. I have stuff torn up real good all over the place and have little piles of \"don't anybody touch\" all over. Nobody touches either! They're such nice people here! Doug was so excited last night. He called from his bedroom, \"Mom, Mom, come here quick!\" I about broke my neck getting in there and he was so excited and said, \"Listen, Mom, listen!\" I listened, but couldn't figure out what he was talking about and finally he said, \"Look! I'm breathing through my nose!\" He hasn't done that for over a month, so guess it was something to be excited about. He got a different antihistamine from the doctor last Monday and evidently it's working. He got up looking so rested this morning. I'm sure he had a light asthma attack last Friday, and explained it to the doctor and he said he was sure that's what it was, too. It's the first time he's ever done that. He says he's getting a \"C or C\" in PE, too, because he just didn't have enough air to run far enough. The classes are so large that the teachers just don't have time to check to see if there's a reason they can't keep up. Mark's graduation announcement came in last night so I cornered Mark and we got those out. Also got Becky's and Donita's graduation gifts off, so have Randy's left and haven't gotten his yet. Boys are harder to shop for than girls are, but I'll get at that soon. I work Saturday and Sunday, go to a NORAD luncheon Monday noon in Novato, and I work Thursday and Friday (30 and 31) and then I'm through (working for money, that is!). Must go or I'll miss my dental appointment. Time is creeping by fast and we'll see you soon.\n",

      "It is a beautiful, beautiful day! Wish I could share it with you! Just got my hair washed and curled so you know where I am right now! Yep! Under the drier! I have everyone bacon in egged and out the door with their lunch sacks, the dishes done, a whipped jello fruit salad made, some hand wash done and a load of clothes through the washer and in the dryers! For me that is good! Of course there is a reason behind my speed! I am supposed to pick Ruth Gibbs up at the guest house and we are going to a \"salad luncheon\" at Col. Maffitts in Novato, Col. Maffitt is the top Canadian military man here and they are such nice people. Col. Siabs is army, and they are going to Naples, Italy in a few days. They are \"Georgia Crackers\", and live right around the corner from us and Col. Siabs and Mutt used to work in the same office. They have been here about the same length of time that we have and she is so nice, too. Col. Maffitt's have a beautiful home in Novato with a big pool, so those that like to swim are to bring their suits, too. Neither Ruth nor I swim, but we both watch real good!!\" Ha! You should see this house! I have it torn up from one end to the other. It is a mess! But I am \"sorting\" and I do not know how to do that neatly. I am beginning to feel like I have accomplished something anyway. I worked yesterday and the day before and thoroughly enjoyed it. Hate to leave this area because there is such a good bunch of people to work with and it is a small hospital, so you know everyone from the janitors to the cooks to the administrators and everyone gets along so well. Rich has exams for the next three days (quarter exams) and then next week it will be finals. Mark has most of his finals next week. Doug has his next week, too. Doug is still having hay fever problems, but I \"think\" it is a little bit better. He knows that then. Dale, air will cure him! I hope he is right. I am going to put him under the vaporizer again tonight to see if we cannot get some more of that gunk in his chest loosened up so he can get it out of there. Mutt just called to see what I was doing! He must not be busy this morning! When I told him, I was talking to my mother\" he said it was Okay! Guess I had better go check the drier, and press a dress to wear, and make my bed, and get some chicken out of the freezer for supper, etc., etc., etc. It just does not seem possible that in just 18 days we will be headed for North Dakota! We are all getting awfully anxious! I dreamed \"North Dakota last night! We had just gotten there and the lady that was supposed to make Helen's anniversary cake had forgotten and gone on vacation and I was trying to get an anniversary cake together at the last minute! I took a white cake out of the oven and that looked nice and then all of a sudden it just deflated like a balloon and was just a pancake. Put an angel food cake in, and that came out beautiful, but as I stood there and looked at it, it just started settling at the bottom and spreading out until it looked like a little hat with a wide flat brim What a night!! Tell Helen to remind the \"cake maker\" not to go on vacation!!! I woke up before I ever got one together that looked right! I have two to make here, before I leave for North Dakota and I hope the dream does not come true! One is for the Chapel picnic Thursday (Memorial Day) and I work but Doug wants to go and one is for the yacht party after the senior fall Saturday night for Mark. I made a beautiful doll cake for Peggy birthday for Rich, so then they will each have one and everybody will be happy. Must go or I will be late. Sure was good talking to you and we will see you soon! \n",

      "Looks like another nice day! How's it look from your window? According to the Tribune you need some rain up that-a-way. \"Father and son\" just left. They walk together in the morning, Mutt to work and Doug to the bus stop. Mark and Rich are still sleeping but they have weight-lifting from 10 to 12 so I'll let 'em sleep a little longer before I \"bacon n' egg\" them. You should have been here yesterday, Mom! Mark and his two buddies had to go to the dispensary and get their \"food handlers\" physical. (Mark got them both jobs as busboys with him at the Officer's Club.) They had their chest x-rays, TB skin tests, etc, and came home here each carrying a paper sack with a cardboard carton in it for a stool specimen. They hadn't had breakfast yet, so I was in the kitchen frying bacon and I heard Mark yell, \"Hey, guys, I got mine!\" Next thing I knew, Alex disappeared. He wasn't gone long, and pretty soon he came into the kitchen and said, \"Mrs. Jones, do I have to fill that carton?\" I kept a straight face and said, \"No, Alex, you don't have to fill it to the top!\" Then Tim disappeared and I thought maybe he'd fallen in, because he was in the bathroom quite awhile and finally he came out looking exhausted and said, \"Ahhh, at last!!\" I didn't dare laugh at them because this was a serious project to them, but it isn't every day that young men come for breakfast and then hold up breakfast while they get a stool specimen. There's a bathroom right there at the dispensary but I guess they never thought of that. I had them run it up to the lab before I'd finish their breakfast! They're really a trio. The house was like a three ring circus yesterday and seemed like I cooked and washed dishes all day, but I'm more content on those days than I am when I have all that horrible peace and quiet! Doug had accordion lessons yesterday. Started him with a new teacher, an old Italian and think he's going to be real good. Doug sure likes him. Had another letter from Rod yesterday. Their squadron won the \"Golden Jock\" for intramural sports (took first in all 7 sports and it's the first time one squadron has done that) and also won the \"Golden Shoe\" for marching, so they're in first for the 81st Fighter Wing trophy given to the best squadron at the end of the summer. Labor Day weekend is \"Parent's Weekend\" and gosh, I'd love to go, but am sure I won't be there. Maybe Mutt can swing a TDY trip to Colorado Springs on business that weekend! Rod knows 5 boys at the Academy, so that helps, too. He said they keep telling him he's supposed to hate that place, but he really likes it. Rich took the Civil Service exams (from 1 PM to 4:30 PM) yesterday and he's determined he's going to the Academy next year. Sure hope he makes it then. Had a letter from Karen (that was \"approved and censored by Jim\") and she said Mama Gene's father passed away several weeks ago. He had cancer and they'd been up to see him a couple months ago. Mutt leaves Tuesday and will be gone till the end of the week, I think, and then will be gone three weeks in August. His first trip is to Portland and then the second one is Portland, several radar sites in Oregon and into Fallon, Nevada (wherever that is) and he will come home when he runs out of clean clothes!! Ha! Well, stopped to fix breakfast for Rich and Mark and then Mutt and Sergeant Sharp stopped by for a few minutes. Found out that Mutt will be gone till the 27th instead of 22nd this month. The washer just shut off, and the drier is full, so better get at those clothes. Have dust an inch thick on all the living room furniture, too. Have \"egg-y\" dishes in the kitchen, too. Yuck!!\n",

      "Mark and Doug are gone and Rich doesn't get up until 9 this morning. Mark came home from classes at 11 AM Friday with a temp of 101.6 and it was 103 degrees all day Saturday and the doctor says \"flu\", so he's back to school today. He's still blowing his nose like mad, and coughing a little, but his temp was normal all day yesterday and he even \"looks\" like Mark today. Yesterday the Scouts had a meeting here at 10 AM and the Scoutmaster was here till 4 PM. He's a young fellow, about 25, getting married December 21, and Mark is his assistant Scoutmaster and I could tell Ed just didn't want to go back to his barracks. He's a nice young man and really good with the Scouts. Karen and Jim were over Sunday evening and we just gabbed and gabbed. Jim plans to go to Long Beach State College next year, so they'll be moving next summer. It sure has been nice to have them close this year. Mutt is supposed to find out this week sometime about where his job will be and we're sure anxious! He is in an apartment alone and much happier with this than the other arrangement he had. This little apartment is so clean, and it's much quieter, and then he doesn't have Hal to contend with. That man was the sloppiest, dirty fellow and it's hard to imagine him a lieutenant colonel, but he was. Rich came home from classes yesterday all elated! He was really sweating out his \"statistics\" class midterm and got it back yesterday with an \"A\" on it, so he was really tickled. He's gotten a B and a B-plus and this A on his midterms but only got a C-minus on his Italian midterm. He's taking that on a \"pass-fail\", so doesn't worry too much about it, but sure works hard on that course. They're allowed to take one course on a \"pass-fail\" basis and if they pass it, they still get credit for it but the grade isn't figured into the grade point average, and if they fail it, it doesn't go on their record as a fail. He was debating on whether to take \"stats\" or \"Italian\" on pass-fail and he evidently picked the right one. Peggy is coming down for Thanksgiving. He thinks he's convinced her to stay in nursing school. I sure hope so, because she's getting real good grades and she just misses Rich and I can understand that, too. Rich is going to Berkeley next year, so he will be able to see her on weekends, so then she will be happy. Mark came home from Terra Linda Homecoming and he says \"Now I think I'm in love,\" and I said, \"Oh, no, not another one!\" and he just chuckled! He's such a nut, I can't imagine him loving one. We had our conference with Mr. Airey and the accordion salesman last Saturday and wheeeeee, by paying $60.28 a month for 3 years and trading in Doug's accordion we could get him the big accordion and amplifier. They'd allow us $271.75 for Doug's accordion and we'd still have to pay $2170.08, so we said, \"No, thank you.\" It includes \"teacher training\" in Santa Ana on Saturdays, but we won't be here to take advantage of that. The salesman said, \"Well, I'll bring over an accordion and amp from Santa Ana this week, anyway, and you'll change your mind and buy it anyway this week.\" He's so darned \"pushy\" and I balk like a mule at a salesman like that! The only advantage this expensive accordion has is the amplification, and about three more switches to change the sound, and the keyboard is a faster action, so the keys come back up quicker and it's easier to play faster, but even Doug thought that was way too much money for the difference in the machine. If we were going to stay here with Mr. Airey for three years, it might be worth it, but not otherwise. These darned salesmen talk so fast and furious that the sum total doesn't hit you till after you're home and put it on paper. I always think it's a good idea to get the figures, come home and think it over at least 24 hours and then decide. We've eliminated a lot of high pressure buys that way. They say, \"It's only 'so much' a month\" and it doesn't sound so bad, until you add on their carrying charges and that's a different picture! Well, I reckon I'd better get dressed and get out of here. Gotta go to the bank to deposit Rich's check for him and get some money for us in here at this house. Have a kitchen full of dirty dishes, too. I went to bed (with dishes stacked in the sink) last night and that was a mistake. It's such a mess in the morning, but can't blame anyone but me! I sure did things differently when I was working! Got a lot more stuff done, but didn't do the \"fun projects\" I do now. Didn't sit around till 10 AM in my robe and gown, either!

      "Well, here we are in \"y'all come\" country. Left Riverside Monday morning and have sailed right along. Just called the boys and Mark said he ate cereal out of a mixing bowl this morning because all the cereal bowls are dirty! By the time I get home next Tuesday, they'll be eating out of the sink. Mark gets his Eagle Scout award presented at a ceremony tomorrow night and Doug gets his \"Start\" award, and we should be there, but Karen and Jim are going to be their parents! We should get to Petersburg, Virginia Friday and then I fly back to Riverside Tuesday. That gives us a couple days to look the area over and check on school for Doug, etc etc etc. We've really enjoyed the trip so far. Louisiana has horrible roads, but Texas had beautiful roads. Am anxious to see Virginia now. Will write when I get home. \n",

      "The frost is on the pumpkin this morning, but the house is nice and warm, anyway. We had the best trip across country, no car trouble, no flat tires, no bad weather, just a real good trip. Rod and I took turns driving and it worked out great. Tina never got sick or piddled in the car, but she sure didn't eat anything either. She was a little lost soul here for a couple days and crawled in under the desk and just stayed there. She's eating and is beginning to come back to life now, though. There is a 13 year old boy (Jeff) next door and he's the only child left at their house now, so he and Doug have become buddies already. There are about 6 boys Doug's age right in the immediate area, so he's happy. We took Rod to Richmond Saturday afternoon so he could fly back to Riverside. He has a date with Susie New Years Eve and also a hop back from March Air Force Base to Colorado on the 3rd. Haven't heard a word the \"bachelor brothers\" yet, so they must not be broke yet. Mutt and I got the living room carpet put down yesterday, and what a job!! It's been rolled up since we had it cleaned while we in N. Dak. in June and it's so nice and \"wavy\". We'll give it a while to fall flat and then if it doesn't behave we'll have to get a carpet man in here to fix it, I guess. We had to cut it again. It's been the best carpet! It's nylon and we bought it in '63 and it's had lots and lots of hard wear, but it's still in real good condition. Had to call a sewing machine repair man, too. The packers broke a couple electric wires off the motor when they packed it. Also smashed in the back of a plastic rocker and smashed both garbage cans flat, scraped the freezer pretty bad, but that's about all, so far. Doesn't pay to have good furniture and move like we do. We had planned on getting some new furniture this year, but I'm not even interested now. I'll wait till buy a house, even if it's 50 years from now. Did get some new drapes for the living room and Doug's room yesterday, so that's done. Have some I can use for our bedroom, but can't put them up till I iron them, and haven't found my iron yet. We have boxes tacked in front of those windows, anyway, but I hope to get some of those out of the way today. By the way, I saw the bill the Co. got from moving us and it was $1938.00. Ye gots! Nothing we have is that valuable, but some are irreplaceable, so as long as they pay the bill it's O.K. I'll keep moving it!  I've met the ladies on both sides of us. One is going to be great neighbor (Jeff's mother), I think, and the other one came to look over the furniture and offer me a drink, at 10 A.M. yet!  She didn't mean \"coffee\", either. Takes all kinds to make a world, I guess. We got here Christmas Day at 3 P.M. and Mutt was sitting in the lounge of the BOQ watching a football game. He was the only one in the BOQ, so he was glad to see us. We were glad to get in because there were very few gas stations open and even fewer places to eat. We ate supper Christmas Day a motel restaurant in Petersburg and think that and the Holiday Inn were the only eating places open on Christmas Day. Christmas Eve there wasn't anything open, so we ate cookies and crackers (out of a coin operated machine) and then had breakfast at a Holiday Inn the next day and found nothing open again until we got here to Petersburg. We decided that Christmas isn't the time travel if you plan to eat out. I had some apples, tangerines, and a few snack packs (pot. chips, etc) and also had my electric percolator and 2# of coffee, so Rod and I enjoyed the coffee, and the snacks were a god send for that starved 13 yr old we're feeding. Doug used to be such a poor eater and he's suddenly started eating everything in sight and he's growing, so he's happy. Found your Christmas check in my wallet yesterday so will it to the back so Pat can keep her books balanced. Thank you so much, Mom! I'll send the boys their dollars. They'll appreciate it more about now, anyway. Did I tell you that Richard got his first quarter grades just before we left Riverside? Well, anyway he got a 4.0 out of a possible 4.0, all A's. He sure was excited over it! Mark is on a semester basis, so he doesn't have finals until the end of January, but he won't have A's. He doesn't have that worry! He says he will get an \"A\" in P.E. anyway, but that's all. This house wasn't clean when we moved in and here we had to pay $100.00 cleaning deposit. The shower is mildewed, the walls are covered with marks, the windows are filthy and the floors are nice! We left the other place glistening so had to start all over again when we got in here, but got in a whole day before the furniture, so got some of it cleaned and now that the furniture hides a lot of spots, it looks better! Sure takes time to get settled in a new place, though, and find a spot for everything. Oh well, I'll have lots of time for that! Col. Spryker called and invited us over Sat. night, but we took a rain check on it, because stuff was in such a mess here then. He was Labrador when Mutt was there. Gotta go wash my hair and have a few other thousand odd jobs to do. Just wanted to chat a while with you and we wish you a Happy New Year, Mom! \n",

      "Radio man just said it's 16 degrees this morning. Still no snow yet, but there's some pretty frost out there this morning. It looks pretty when you're on the inside looking out, but bet it's chilly out there. Mutt and Rick and Mark called from Santa Monica last night. Rick and Mark met Mutt at the Los Angeles airport and took him to Santa Monica and then they called me on the \"free phone.\" Mutt was going to take them out to dinner after they called me. Am sure they'll appreciate the free meal. Mutt is to come back here Friday but is having trouble getting a seat because of everyone going to Washington for the inauguration on Monday. So far he goes by Delta Air Lines to Atlanta and Eastern into D.C. and Richmond. Then if he's lucky and Doug and I can find the Byrd Airport in Richmond at night, we'll pick him up at 830 P.M. We got our Christmas present this Saturday, a color TV and a stereo. Doug and I were in front of that TV all afternoon and until 9 P.M. last night. This kinda foolishness has to stop or nothing else will be done around here! Also got to play Dad's Academy Chorale records he brought us and couldn't play on our HiFi. It isn't everyone that listens to Christmas Carols the middle of January, but that's O.K. I'm so tickled that we got the color TV before the Inauguration because maybe we'll see Rodney. I told you, didn't I, that the Academy Chorale is singing for the Inauguration. Well, anyway, they are, and he called collect to tell us so. Have an appointment next week with an orthodontist to see about Doug and his teeth. We'll be glad when we get that out of the way again. He had hoped to get the braces off by the end of the summer and just wear the retainer, but we'll see what this fellow says now. Each one is different and has his own ideas, but one thing I won't agree to and that is to let them pull any teeth just to speed up the process. Doug is adjusting well to school. He flunked the first history test he took and so did another boy that started the same day Doug did, but the teacher told them not to worry about it. Mutt and I went over to Colonel Sander's Saturday night and had the nicest evening. Doug and Jeff stayed here in front of the new TV and were still there when we got home at 11:30 P.M. Jeff's parents were going to a party, so it's nice that the two boys could stay together and entertain each other. They sure get along well. Spraker's have just one son and he's in college at San Mateo, California. They both work. She's an executive secretary and has been for years and works at Fort Lee, too. They're living in an apartment because they couldn't find a house here. Spose I should go clean up that kitchen! Doug and I really goofed off yesterday with the new TV and soooo no dishes got done! It's a mess! Mutt would fire us, but when the cat's away the mice will play, and we sure did that yesterday! Have to go to the bank and to get some gas in the old buggy, and get some groceries today, and I'm not at all sure of my directions, so better get dressed and get started so I have time to get lost! Got my Virginia driver's license and that was $7.00 and only good for one year. My California license was good for 5 years (till August 1970) and only cost $3.00 and they took that away from me!! Now we can't go back to California because I don't have a California license anymore! Ha!! Just give me a chance to go back out there and see those goofy kids and I'll go, license or not!! Miss their idle chatter! Gotta go! \n",

      "It's a sunny day. Radioman says 32 degrees, so that is not too bad. It is real clear, anyway. Yesterday the fog was thick as cream soup until almost noon, but it is bright and sunny today. Doug just left for the bus stop, so Tina is going from room to room whining. She thinks she is a \"people\", but she is a brown dog and Doug's school is all white, so she has to wait for desegregation. Found an accordion teacher for Doug and he has his first lesson today right after school. The teacher is the minister of the Church of the Nazarene. Have not met him yet, just talked to him on the phone, but we will give it a try. If he is not good, we will just have to go into Richmond once a week. Found an orthodontist, too, and found a scout troop to join, so things are shaping up again. Always takes awhile to get things going again after a move. Mutt has found a handball court up the road here and he and four or five other officers from Ft. Lee air defense command have been going over about twice a week for a couple hours and they really enjoy it. It is such a fast moving game and his sweat pants and shirt are dripping wet when he brings them home to wash them, but he says the exercise really feels good and he comes home so refreshed. He feels so much better when he gets some exercise. I know what he means! I have gotten so sluggish feeling just from lack of exercise. Spring is just around the corner, though, and then I will get out and do something. Doug and I went over and bowled two lines Sunday afternoon while Mutt played handball and today I ache all over, so I know, I need the exercise. Just finished a pillow top for a pillow for the couch. They are two lavender pillows with the crocheted \"afghan squares\" tops that you made for me years ago, before we went to Japan and don't know why, but the yarn faded for some reason! Could not be from over fifteen years constant use, could it?? anyway, I got a burlap pillow top kit, with a purdy rooster with fringe feathers and this morning I finished it while Doug ate breakfast and talked. Have not quite decided what to cover the other pillow with, but I am thinking and that is a progress, you know! I had recovered the pillow part before and reversed the afghan, but it finally was just too faded to use. I just hate to part with old things! I am some kind of a nut, I guess. Oh, by the way, I cleaned up that little gasoline lamp that you used when we had whooping cough and sprayed it gold and it is beautiful. Still have to find a little chimney for the lamp so I am watching in knickknack departments and toy departments for little lamps with perfume or something in them and some day I will find one with a chimney with a 1/2\" base that I can use for the lamp. The Tribune came yesterday and boy! you've really had some awfully cold weather! Sure glad you are in where it is warm. Bet Helen and Les are glad they are not out there carrying water and heating with coal this winter! Had a letter from Helen, and she sounded so content and happy. Have not heard from my kids for over a week, so if I do not hear by Sunday, I will call them and get them out of bed Sunday morning. Got a note from Uncle John yesterday stating the boys had been in and he had prayed and cleaned their teeth and neither of them had any cavities. (That still leaves Rich with not a single filling! The lucky dog!). Mark has not had any cavities for 1 1/2 years or so, and they brush with Crest! Who knows? Maybe it does help?! I quote from Uncle John's letter, \"The boys (yours) mustaches are well trimmed and they are very neatly dressed gentlemen. Are notcha proud as punch with them?\" He did not include a bill, so now I gotta find out if the boys paid for it, or if he \"forgot\" the bill. If so, I will send him a Virginia Ham! That will fix him! He said they all had the flu during Christmas, but are better and over it all now. Gosh, I gotta get busy, my kitchen floor is filthy and Doug's darned black heels have left marks all over it. Will be glad when he outgrows these and I will look for shoes with no black heels! Happy Valentine's Day. \n",

      "Doug just left for the bus stop. It's a wee bit chilly out there this morning, 25 degrees. No snow, though, best guess the rest of the state has it this morning and New York is practically shut down with 16\" of snow this morning, schools closed and the newsman says the going rate for a taxi, if you can get one, is a minimum of $100.00. Mutt had to go to work at midnight last night and he isn't home yet. He looked half asleep when he left here last night. We called the boys last night and everything is fine down there. Was relieved to hear that Jim decided to stay in school until June, at least. The boys had been to Palm Springs to Bob Hope golf tournament. We sat here and watched it on TV and if I'd known those kids were there, I'd have paid closer attention to the spectators! Peggy's roommate had gotten the tickets for them, so they got in free. Mark says he's dating a Lutheran minister's daughter and I told him that was alright! Ha! He said that he and Rich had both sent us a letter last Thursday or Friday, so now I can watch for the mail in earnest. Learned mail doesn't get here until sometime between 3:15 and 4:00 pm, so I watch all day, anyway! I like morning mail and then the suspense of what's in the mailbox if over early in the day. I was beginning to wonder what had happened to those two knuckleheads when we hadn't heard from them for about 3 weeks, but it's \"payday\" for them the 15th of the month, and it was getting close. I told them when I left there, that if I didn't hear from them every once in awhile they wouldn't hear from me, either, and I was the gal that wrote the check out for them, soooooo no letters, no check. I called Petersburg General Hospital to see if they hired part-time help, and they said \"Yes,\" only on nights, though, so I'm not interested. They pay $8.00 less a day, too, than California does. I'll just keep looking and I'll find something soon to fill my idle hours. I've done all parts of piddly projects, but must find something to get out with people or I'm gonna go stir crazy! and that's not good. Yesterday afternoon we went for a ride, just to see some of the residential areas in Colonial Heights and Petersburg. Found out there's Virginia State College about 5 miles from here, and John Tyler Community College about 10 miles north and then there's a Richard Bland College that we didn't find but it's within 15 miles. Maybe I'll get an application and go back to school. I'd love to work in Public Health or Occupational Therapy but they both require a degree. Maybe I can find some volunteer work of some kind along that line. I'm working on a rug now that Kay showed me how to make on the sewing machine. Its just wrapping yarn around a wire gadget made from a clothes hanger and stitching down the middle and sliding the wire back and winding it as you go and then just cut the loops when you finish. Anything to kill time, but it's looking pretty good. I painted some picture frames (that got nicked on the move here) Saturday. The boys said last night that they're going to save their money and come home for Christmas. They're selling life insurance to college kids, and so far they've earned $75.00 each!! Ha! They're characters! When Mark talked to his dad last night he told his dad that they expected to get their license this week and then they'd be on their own and would make about $400.00 on every policy they sold. I talked to Rich after that and he said they'd make about $100.00 for each policy they sold. Rich said he sold $43,000.00 worth of insurance last month, but of course, their manager gets credit for this until they get their license, so I'm anxious to see just what they'll do and when they'll get their license. As long as the manager keeps them on a \"trainee\" basis, he gets the money for the sale, so I can see why he's not anxious to let them get their license, but they said they're going to get it this week. We'll see. Always like to get Rich's answer instead of Mark's because Mark sure can get \"euphoric\" when it comes to talking about how much money they'll make and he has a tendency to look at the world through rose-colored glasses, but maybe that's why he's so happy. Also asked them about their dental bill and they said Uncle John told them he'll send the bill to us! Of course, he just sent a note to tell us what he'd done to the boys teeth and there was no bill in there! I'm going to get a Virginia Ham and send to him and something for Tina and John from this \"Civil War\" area. He's such a good egg. Well, I've rattled on - well for goodness sakes, no there is a fleet of Russian fishing travelers and supply ship off the Virginia Coast, about 100 of 'em 5 miles off shore. Better get my cookbook out and find a recipe for \"Borscht,\" might get company for dinner! Ha! The Coast Guard is out there keeping an eye on 'em. Must get busy. Asked Doug as he went out the door if he had a message for Grandma and he said, \"Yep! Tell her I'm lovin' her always and ask her if she'll be my valentine.\" We went to the baptist church yesterday morning because it was \"Sweet\" Sunday and Doug was taking \"collection.\" His troop had most of the service and it was good. Like I said a couple times before, I gotta go!! \n",

      "Wellllllll, we still know nuthin!!  There getting kinda \"itchy\", though, cuz the days are creeping by and June 30th isn't far off.  SDC has fellows all over the U.S. to place on jobs and Mutt has talked to several and none of them have heard, either, so we're not alone with our \"itchin\".  Oh, well, no use worrying about it; just wanted to keep you posted, anyway.  Went to Interior Design class all morning and it was pretty good.  Yeah, that was yesterday.  Now it's May 6th, Doug just left for school.  Got the Tribune yesterday and see where Marcella Olson and Martha Bale put in their resignations, too.  What gives up there, anyway??  Got a letter from Karen and Jim was to take entrance exams for \"San Diego State\" last Saturday.  He graduates from City College June 10th with an AA degree (that's Associate in Arts, I think, isn't it?).  Anyway, his mother and stepdad are going to try to get out there for that.  We're going to miss that and looks like we'll miss the Shalers, too, at the rate we're going!.  Rodloman just said it was going to be in the high 80's today.  It a such \"a sultry hot\" when it gets hot here.  Rodney called Sunday night and will call again Thursday night to let us know whether they're going to be at Bolling Air Force Base or Andrews Air Force Base.  They're both in D.C  Wed A.M., Darn!  Suppose I'll ever finish this? My neighbor called and wanted to go to the base, so I went with her and we goofed a couple hours way.  I needed a sheet of poster paper for my \"Interior Design\" project and had to go to several stores before I found one.  For my project I'm designing a basement rec room and I'm using Margie's basement.  I don't have her basement measurements, so I guessed at the size and overshot it a bit I think, but it's a \"circus\" rec room.  Since we don't have to figure cost on this, I can go hog wild.  It's all in red, white and blue.  I'll send it to Margie when I finish with it and she can bring it up to show you.  They'll be on display at the June luncheon of the Officer's Club and then I'll just roll it up and mail it to Marge.  Time out again Mom as she just went visiting again somewhere (Mutt).  Ha!! My neighbor call and said, \"I just got all six kids off to school!  Whew!  Come have a cup of coffee.\"  So I did and Mutt had to come home and change from his new shoes to his old shoes, cuz his feet were hurting him, and then when I sat down to finish your letter, I discovered he'd been home while I was away drinking coffee!!  He's a nut!!  Must write to the boys and send them some money.  Their rent is due the 15th again.  I'm sure they'll be eager for the extra for food, etc. that goes with it too.  Mark got a job at Holiday Inn which will help I'm sure, so maybe they have a couple extra dollars this month.  Do you finally have all the snow melted up that-away?  Is the water all soaked in?  Are you getting better at your \"feet handling\" or are they just suborn as ever?  Seeeeee, I'm full of questions.  I'd better get away! Have the washer and dryer both going and clothes stacked high to fold, so I'd better get at it.  Will let you know as soon as we know anything! \n",

      "Just a few quick lines to say \"Howdy\" before I leave for Interior Design class. I finished \"Margie's Rec Room\" so I can take that today. She present it and then everyone criticizes it. Had a letter from Loline and little Johnnie has something wrong with the way the hip bone fits into the socket, so is on crutches with his leg in a sling in the daytime and has a 5H traction on it at night and then she takes him to the pool everyday after school to exercise it and says it has improved quite a bit. She noticed him limping and when she questioned him, he said his leg just hurt him, but when it did not get better, she decided she had better have it checked. Said he was so good and did not complain or seem to mind any of the treatment and inconveniences. She still have heard nothing but rumors about what SDC is going to do with us. Rumors fly from every direction, but nothing verified yet. Looks like Langley, Virginia (near Norfolk) might be it, but Santa Monica has a meeting today with Norad (North American air defense) and they find out about what they can do according to how they are affected by the budget cut. Oh, well, they will tell us someday, and then I will tell you! Fair enough?? good! Doug went to Virginia Beach yesterday with Higgins (next door) and really had a good time, got home about 8.30 last night and did he go to sleep fast!! They swam, and they fished, and did not catch any fish, but just had a real good time. Mutt just called and he left his glasses home, so now if I remember to take them with me, he can pick them up at the office club. He cannot see to do any work without them. Really does not have much to do, with the office terminating, anyway, but he sure cannot see the \"printed word\" without the glasses! Mutt and I worked in the yard yesterday and pulled weeds like crazy. Looks nice to day, anyway. It was just too pretty to stay inside, and we were kinda \"lost\" with no kids at home. I owe that Patty Pistrissa a letter, too. Keep waiting to write till I have some news and welllllllll, we are still sitting and waiting, so guess I had better catch up on some of this correspondence. Must run, Do not wanna be late! Nobody here to say \"Hurry Betty,\" so I have to rush myself! Darn! Be good, and will write soon when I have something to tell you. PS Just came back from Interior Design class and they loved Margie's rec. room! The instructor said she could not offer any constructive criticism, and decided the room had everything! Ha! Mutt just called me, and says, no news mama, so I can repeat the phrase to you! now you know as much as I do. It is raining, too, son of ma gun!! The air is just sticky. Gotta go make my bed and do the dishes, and make an angelfood cake for us fat people. They are both getting fatter every day! I need to go to work or take up farming or join a ditch digging crew or something like that. Just don't get enough exercise! gotta go, mucho love and hope you had a nice mother's Day. I did, because we got to see one of our lost chilluns, old Rodney LeRoy, that is!\n",

      "The sun is shining, but it sure was a nippy night. Movers got everything unloaded by 4 p.m. and we're playing \"Christmas\" now. Everybody gets to open packages! Richard and Peggy brought Tina home. They got here at 3 a.m. this morning, so they're all sleeping except Tina. She's wandering around sniffing everything and probably trying to find Doug. You should have seen that dog last night. First off she wasn't even going to come in the house and then she turned around and headed back to Rich's car. Finally coaxed her in and it seemed like all of a sudden she remembered who we were and she just ran from room to room until she finally found Doug in his bed and she jumped up on his bed and licked his cheek and just cried and cried and her tail going 90 MPH! Once she found Doug she was alright again. We got here about 10:45 or 11:00 a.m. the 8th. Picked up a paper and rentals were practically nil. Saw a realty office right by where we'd stopped, went in and asked about rentals and the lady said she had a 4-bedroom just vacated, but hadn't even looked at it yet. We came with her and lordy! what a dirty, filthy mess!! The house is only about 9 years old and the wood and all is in pretty good shape, but it was just plain filthy. She said she'd have it painted and she got right on the ball and would you believe they painted the whole inside and outside of the house! She's having two walls in the kitchen panelled and they're to do that this morning. Doug and I scrubbed cupboards inside and out and I spent several hours trying to clean up that stove! It's going to be real nice once we get everything settled. I had three carpets and am able to use all three and \"yours truly\" cut and trimmed carpets yesterday till I was blue in the face, but got them all fitted almost wall to wall. It's a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house, so I have a diningroom. None of my drapes are going to fit again it looks like. I bought the good \"thermal lined\" ones in Virginia and might be able to use one pair in the 3rd bedroom. Just hate to cut them off till I know how long we might be here. Mutt went to work this morning. We drove out to the base day before yesterday and it sure is small. Have to go to the commissary today. Have one half-gallon of milk, one tomato, and a jar of hamburger pickles in the refrigerator. Care to dine with us?? Got a package of breakfast rolls for breakfast and there's cold cereal. Haven't unpacked silverware yet. Can't find the right box, but have some plastic spoons, and I found the cereal bowls last night. Got all the linens unpacked and put away and found the bedding, so at least we could go to bed last night and was that ever welcome. Then I couldn't sleep because I was listening for Rich and Peg and Tina to come in, so it was a mixed up night. That old \"T-bird\" behaved the rest of the way out here, but it smelled \"burned\" real strong and I kept my eyes peeled on the dash for any signs of smoke, but it behaved. Gotta go get dressed before the carpenters get here to fix the panelling and catch me in my robe! Will write again when we're a little more settled. Sure was good to get home and see everyone. Must run. \n",

      "Mutt just left for work, and all is quiet here. Doug is sleeping. Finally got the garage all straightened out this weekend, and yesterday I spent all day crawling around the floor getting the old wax and filth off the mopboards and kitchen floor. I put two fresh coats of wax on the floor and you'd never know it's the same room. It really was bad, but couldn't get at that till I got the boxes unpacked and dishes all washed, etc. Have to get \"change of address\" cards off to the Tribune and to the Virginia motor vehicle dept and all the magazines again. Have to study the Oregon driver's manual and go get my driver's license, too. Every state's laws are different. Oregon has a law on \"passing horses\", a car must \"stop and take reasonable precautions\" if the horse appears frightened\"! I hope if I have to pass a horse on a highway and it is frightened that it will just turn around and say \"Lady, I'm frightened! Stop your car!\" There are laws on \"leading animals on highways\" and \"livestock hers on sides of roads\" and it's illegal to haul children or dogs in the back of an open truck. Also, pedestrians don't have the right of way like they do in several other states, so if they jay-walk, it's O.K. to run over them, I guess. No, I won't try that! Ordered a drape for the Patio door and the dining area window so they should be in this week sometime. There are no storm windows on this house and I can see where they evidently had sheets of plastic taped over the outside of the windows, so I ordered a thermal drape for the patio door. $25.90 for a drape! The wind and light won't come through it, anyway. Say, how 'bout that \"moon landing\"! Thought the films taken of them walking around on the moon exceptionally good, but hope we don't go overboard and put everything into moon research, cuz it sure didn't look like there was anything there to get excited about, other than the satisfaction having gotten there, and back safely. Doug joined a Boy Scout troop and is going camping with them July 27-Aug. 3rd. Mutt and I are going to take 5 boys up there and then go get them when they're ready to come home. They go to Crescent Lake, about 100 miles N. of here. It will be a nice drive, anyway. The \"T-bird\" is in the garage getting the rest of the fire damage repaired. Should get it home this week. SDC has a van that they own and all SDC people ride up to Keno in that. There are three programmers, a Sec'y, and Mutt, so they pick him up at the door. By September, the programmers and Sec'y, will be gone and Mutt will be the only SDC person left here and he thinks they're going to sell their vehicle then. He says the T-bird will never make it up and down that narrow mountain road all winter, but he thinks he can ride a military bus up from Kingsley AF Base which is only  about 3 miles from here. That leaves the base at 6:15 A.M., though. Just something else that has to be \"figured out\" and no use worrying about that till the time comes. Haven't met the \"Jane Lee Stuntebecks\" yet, but their drug store is just a few blocks from our house, so will get over there one of these days. Must get moving. Have to take Doug out for a smallpox vacc. so he can go camping. Have to call the vet, too, as I'm pretty sure Tina has worms! The backyard is fenced, so she's outside all day and loves it. Gotta get busy. Has the weather warmed up there yet? It's hot here in the P.M. and early part of the night, but before morning, have to grab the blanket and cover up. Just gotta go! \n",

      "Looks like it's going to be a pretty day. The sun is shining and there's a cool breeze, but I sure miss the birds. You just hear \"people\" noises here, like trucks and cars and kids and dogs, but no birds. We had the nicest trip to San Rafael to see the kids. Northern California (especially the Mount Shasta area) is so pretty now, but guess they really get the snow in the winter, too. We spent one night at the Holiday Inn where Mark works \"room service.\" He came knocking on our door about 10 AM and when I opened it he said, \"Excuse me, Lady, but I have to use your bathroom.\" I told him that we'd never had \"room service\" like that before and he just laughed. Rich came over Friday after class (PM) and then the boys and Dad went to the stock car races in Petaluma Friday night. We went to see Winnie and Emory (Mutt's cousins) Saturday PM. They're the best people. That Winnie is about 64, weighs about 95 pounds and just bubbles with energy. Emory was head of California State Highway Patrol for quite a few years before he retired. He has diabetes, so has lost some weight since we saw him last, but he says he feels good and just can't eat as much anymore, but says he doesn't miss all the extra stuff he was eating before. Doug is still sleeping. He's \"14\" today and Mark is 19. I'm going to make a small birthday cake for Doug and then will make one for Mark when he gets home at the end of the month. Took Doug to Wards yesterday and he got a new shirt, some \"flared leg trousers and a brown suede belt and he thinks he's the sharpest thing in town. Even came home and polished his shoes so they'd look good and then he sat here all spruced up and waited for Mutt to come home from work. Most of the trousers Doug's size have longer legs and if you shorten them, you lose the \"taper,\" and these had 25.5 inch inseam instead of 28 inch so fit perfect. (Now watch the son of a gun grow and you can't lengthen these either.) Got Doug all set in school. He's going to be taking English, Spanish I, Biology, Algebra, PE, and Frosh Choir. He still says he wants to be a doctor, so I asked him if he planned to sing his patients back to health, since he's taking choir and he said, \"Sure.\" School starts September 3. Got him lined up with an orthodontist (only one in town) and \"visited\" him yesterday. Today we have a 1 PM appointment with an accordion teacher. I'm still thinking seriously about seeing if I can find part-time work after school starts. suppose Maria is in Minneapolis now. I would think that would be very interesting. Doris Chabot's daughter is taking a similar course, I guess, in Ashland, Oregon. I think she said Debbie goes to St. Louis, Missouri for four weeks after she finishes in Ashland. Got a letter from our neighbors in Virginia and the Kettlewell's (he's the fellow with no legs) had a 10.5 pound son on August 6. She was due the same time Sadie is. Sure a good thing she didn't go any longer or she'd have had an elephant! Everyone was kidding Pat and Don (Kettlewell) so, and telling them that Pat looked like she was going to have twins, and she really was huge, much bigger than Sadie is. Am sure they're glad it's just one, though, especially with Don and his Buerger's disease. Mom, do you remember the Prottenglier's? They were stationed with us in Albuquerqueerque and then were at Minot when we were at Grand Forks. He was a radio announcer at Minot and they were at a picnic we had in Minot one summer (1959??) (must have been July because I made doll birthday cake for Mona and Maria and brought them to the picnic). We went to their apartment a little while after the picnic. Gloria and Punk (or \"Paul Arthur\" as he's called on radio) had 5 boys. Well, anyway, while we were at Frank's I got Punk's mother's address out of the Minneapolis phone directory and wrote her when we got here. Was a bit shocked when I got her letter and found out they're divorced and Punk married a Minot divorcee with a 13-year-old son in 1962. Gloria has the 5 boys and is still in Billings, Montana where they went from Minot. Punk and Darlene are in Florida and both work for a radio station there. We had lost track of them since they were in Minot. Their oldest boy has a full scholarship to Stanford, so must be a pretty bright boy. He's the same age as Mark. Then they have boys 17, 16, 14, and 12. Anyway, we felt pretty badly when we heard about it. It must be awfully hard on the boys with no father around and also hard for Gloria to raise 5 boys by herself. The boys take turns going to visit their Dad, one boy each summer so that means they see him once every 5 years!! The 17-year-old had trouble of some sort in school last year, so has to repeat his junior year, so there'll be 2 in junior class this year. We got a letter from Punk this week. I wrote to Gloria, but haven't heard from her, and Punk's mother sent him our address and he wrote straight away. I'd rather hear from Gloria, though. Well, I gotta get moving. I never know when to shut up when I start talking to you! Just keep going on and on. \n",

      "Mailman just brought your birthday card and now I just gotta talk to you awhile! The card was beautiful! Think I'll try to fix a frame for the \"Birthday Prayer\" and \"no Prayer goes unheard\" and put it here in the kitchen. Thank you so much! It seems you must have a 6th sense some place that tells you what others enjoy! Got a letter from Rod this morning and he must really have had a good time in Rugby. Said Mona and Mark took him water skiing several times and he sure had fun. You were kinda \"overrun with young men grandsons all at once weren't you? I just hope that when we get grandchildren they'll think as much of us as yours do of you! There are many that don't, you know, and wouldn't give their grandparents the \"time of day\". They don't know what they're missing. Rich and Mark are coming home September 5th so we're anxiously waiting. Karen and Jim had planned to come up in September, too, but haven't heard when. She and Mark don't do too well at pushing a pencil or pen across stationery very frequently. Got a letter from Rich today, too. He and Rod write every 10 days or so, but Mark and Karen manage it about once every 3 or 4 months. Mutt got a nice surprise last week. A \"TWX\" came in from Air Defense Command to the Keno Commander stating that the A.F. budget was so far in the red that all \"civilian trainers\" were to be discontinued. Keno and 4 other sites terminate as of November 1st, sooooo Mutt will be leaving there by then. They requested that the civilian trainers train military men to take over the computers November 1st!! Mutt can't figure out how to train inexperienced men in two months, to do what it's taken him months of schooling (3 months in Florida, 3 months in Kansas, 4 months in Santa Monica) and years of experience on the computers, to learn! Naturally, the Commander is pretty upset because he knows it's practically impossible to even take a man with some experience and train him in two months to do even a poor job, and how well the personnel perform on the job reflects right back on the Commander, soooo he has his problems, too, I guess. SDC called Mutt and said they have no intention of letting him go, but will have to place him somewhere else because there's no other job in this area for him. They also gave him a nice juicy raise, so maybe they like him and will keep him. In the meantime, Doug and I will just proceed as usual with the new orthodontist, the new accordian teacher, and school, and pretend we're going to be here forever! Suppose I should be shook or worried, 'specially since we worked so hard to clean this place up, but I didn't lose any weight over it, so it couldn't have hurt me any! Ha!! We'll just have to \"play it by ear\" again for the next few months. One thing for sure, life never gets dull around here! SDC is a little shook over this too, because this contract isn't up for reevaluation until next June, but guess if it's \"Gov't\", they can do what they please, when they please. There are 5 sites to be closed November 1st, 5 more by June, and the rest right after that. Joe Mooney went to school with Mutt in Santa Monica and then went to Montgomery Alabama when we went to Virginia. He's married to a girl from Bismarck, so they went via Bismarck to Massachusetts at the same time we came out here, and the Massachusetts site closes November 1st, too, soooo they'll be moving, too. At least if we're terminated, we're on the right coast! Joe is from California and if the Co. terminates you, they won't pay to move you any place, so he might be stuck in Massachusetts. At least we have that blessed retirement check that would pay rent and beans, anyway, which a lot of these fellows don't have. What's that Sadie waiting for?? Sure am anxious to hear what, when, how many and that mother and ??? are fine. Doug and I found a \"Tot Shop\" and are dying to go buy something. We went in and \"looked\" and there are so many darling things in there! That \"Monie\" only has one more month, too, and then Doug and I can go back to the \"Tot Shop\" again. He's as bad as I am about babies and baby things. He still says he wants to be a Dr. V specialize in O.B. He's changed his mind so often before, but has been stuck on \"a doctor\" for about a year now, so who knows? Maybe he might make it? Well, I guess I've rambled on long enough! It's 1:30 P.M. and I've sure done \"not much\" today. Good thing I'm not \"working for wages.\" I'll keep you posted on \"what's new\" with us (and that could be anything, it seems. Ha!) and you keep me posted on how you and the whirlpool get along, and news of Sadie. \n",

      "Welllllll, kids all gone again and me n' my shadow are here alone again. Thanks so much for news of Sadie and daughter! I was beginning to worry about her, so long overdue. Bet there's really excitement at that house! Hope they get that new house, too, because they'll sure need it with that new baby now. Got up at 4 a.m. and fixed bacon and eggs for Rich (and a lunch to take with him) and he left on the 5:05 a.m. bus. Mark took that early bus last Sunday a.m., too. Sure did enjoy having those boys home. Mark was here from Wednesday to Sunday and Rich from Friday to Friday. Sent them both off with some new school clothes, and everything else cleaned and mended so that ought to hold them a while. There's sure a void here, after having somebody here all the time! We still have heard nothing from SDC. They've already laid off over 60 men, most on the East Coast, but we're expecting to hear something soon. The suspense is worse than knowing. Doug and I know we'll be here till end of 1st Semester, but sure would be nice to know where Mutt will be after November 1st. Think it's starting to get to him, because he sure rolls and tosses at night and doesn't sleep much. It's only 6 weeks till November 1st, so have to hear something soon. Hey, the mailman brought me the prettiest cameo brooch!! Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you!!! That sure brightened the day!! We're invited to a Squadron \"Get Acquainted\" party at the Officers Club Saturday night. Now I'll have to find something I can wear my cameo with. I think I have it all figured out, too. I really didn't expect anything so thanks again! Pat and Margie both wrote about Helen's job at the H.S. I'm so glad for her! Know she will enjoy it, too. Was surprised to hear they closed OB. at Deaconess. Our population must be falling off like crazy up there. Oh, well, the slums are still prolific! Kinda eerie, wonder if we're going to have a generation of \"slum folks\" at that rate. Still there are more and more going to college, so maybe that will balance it out. Welllllll, I've just gotta get dressed and run out to the commissary. We're out of milk and bread and eggs. Sure made a difference how fast things disappeared with two big boys here. I baked cake and pies and had a ball just watching them eat it. Doug sure enjoyed them, too. Mark taught Doug some Karate, too. Rich was out here cutting the grass one day and got down to clip around the edges of the lawn and somehow did something to that blamed knee again and just rolled on the grass hanging onto his leg. He couldn't walk on it for a while but finally it snapped back someway and I wrapped it in an elastic bandage and he could get around again, but it was still hurting when he left. It doesn't fill up with fluid, anyway, so that helps, but it's sure undependable. The pain is always in the back of knee. Sometimes it behaves quite a while, but when it goes, he goes right down with it. Says he doesn't dare carry anything downstairs unless he has one hand free to hang onto a handrail because it \"goes\" when he least expects it, and it just kinda makes him mad! Shoot! I gotta go! Thanks again for the news, the brooch and everything! \n",

      "Well, as I wrote the date in the corner, it dawned on me that today my first born is 22 years old. I have had two letters from Karen in less than ten days and she just never writes, but she was all excited over her new job. Did I tell you, she is personal secretary to Hospital Administrator and the Regional administrator of a new Convalescent and Rehabilitation Hospital, that is to open in a week or so. They pay her $112.00 a month more than her old job paid and it is only 8 blocks from where she lives. Jim is all set in school, changed his major to Psychology. I did not go to Terra Linda as planned, decided to write for a newspaper and look at that first. You would not believe the cost of rental and real estate there!, 3 bedroom house rent from $300.00 a month to $750.00 a month. 2 bedrooms are from $285.00 to $500.00, and then utilities on top of that??, Forget it!! Now Mutt has a \"San Diego\" bug, so Karen is going to send us a paper from there so we can look that over. We still have received nothing in writing from SDC, but it is supposed to get here this week and this is Friday, so maybe it will get here today. Mutt will have to go to Santa Monica for termination, we think, sure has a lot of families around the U.A. in a stew. Mutt is the only one of the bunch being terminated November 1st, that has a pension to fall back on till another job comes along. Picked up the Klamath Falls \"Herald News\" a couple days ago, and was just glancing through the pages before I started supper, glanced at the \"Servicemen in the news\" and flipped the page, thinking \"that kid sure looks like Rodney\", turned the page back, and was dumbfounded to find it was. Have no idea how they get these articles. Rodney must have finally gone in and changed his \"home\" address, and guess the academy must send these out. Anyway, we were sure surprised! (By the way, read the article on the back \"woman cited\", Is not that something? Guess great grandma had one too many!!) Talked to Rich Tuesday night. His knee is \"going out\" on him all the time now, so he has decided to check again with the orthopedic man to see if there is anything they can do with it. Rich said Mark was working long hours and they had put him in charge of the bus boys and all the banquets, luncheons, etc. Hope that stinker does not let his schoolwork slide. He enjoys his work at Holiday Inn more than he does \"book larnin\" anyway, I think. Well, reckon I had better get busy. Got up at 5.00 and made breakfast, for Mutt (he had to go to work early), then I had three cups of coffee while Doug had breakfast and then I exercised with Jack La Lanne and sure shook that coffee up. I think my eyeballs are floating! Mutt is taking a load of Boy Scouts \"someplace\" tomorrow, and will go back and get them Sunday. Doug has a \"patrol\" now, so we have groceries for nine boys sitting here on the table, and stuff in the freezer and refrigerator. He got a call to perform with his accordion October 4th, too, so he will have to practice a couple numbers for that. The football team he managed won their first game yesterday and he came home happy! They have lost three, I think. He sure got into stuff fast for only being here a little over two months and is so content here! He likes it so much better than Virginia! Course in Virginia there were 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th all in one school, and here the whole school is just 9th graders (over 500 of them) and he really likes it. He still plans to be a flr. We will see, he would sure be pleased if he did go that route, but kids do change their minds often. Gotta go! \n",

      "Jack LaLanne is exercising, and I am watching him! Don not know that it does anything for me, just watching, but who knows! I might end up with the trimmest slimmest eyeballs in the nation! Mutt just called from Reno Mt. and said the view from up there is just beautiful. They have snow up there. Thought we were going to get snow here yesterday but it just rained. You should see my latest project! I made a cabinet for the table leaves (for that old table of yours) and have the first coat of varnish on it now. I put a dark walnut stain on it and it matches my China cabinet and now I would like to redo the table and leaves, but that will have to wait until we get to San Diego. Karen and Jim are house hunting for us. Packers come October 30th and load it the 31st and we leave after Doug \"manages\" their last football game of the season. Karen called the other night and had found a house but they only wanted to rent it for 6 months, so Cue said \"720\" because Cue J. Cet cannot move Doug again during the school year, so they are going to look some more. SDC will pay for furniture storage for 30 days, but we are hoping to avoid that. Had a letter from Frances inviting us for Thanksgiving but we will be far, far away by then. We got Jim's address, anyway, so we will be able to track him docon when we get there. Should not be any trouble to find him now that he is singing in the \"Bluejackets Choir Company.\" Karen said you were taking some correspondence course. I think that is great!! Know the thirst you have always had for more and more knowledge and it is sure an admirable trait! There; so much education and training available, if people would avail themselves to it. I am taking a course in sewing \"knits\" and think I just groped up my first attempt! She said \"stretch and stitch\" and I think I \"stretched\" too much as I \"stitched\" because I got a seam with more wave than the Pacific and it is not supposed to look like that! I made the mistake of buying a cheap, loose weave knit to practice on and there is just too much \"give\" to it for a beginner, anyway. Oh well, line your six daughters up for sewing class and I would be the one sitting on a stool in a corner with a dunce hat on!! Oh well, it would have to have an \"E\" for effort on the front of the dunce hat, anyway. Doug's school pictures came yesterday and they are good. He is so tickled over them because it is the first he has had without either crooked teeth or \"wires\" showing. He wears retainers, but put them in his pocket while he had the picture taken. The $1000.00 cost was worth it, though, to have the teeth come out so nice and straight, and he smiles with confidence now! He is going to a school dance tonight. He really likes the school here. All the 9th graders are in a school by themselves and I think it is great. 9th graders are either usually the \"big kids\" and \"examples\" at a Junior Hi. or the \"little boys\" in a 4 year High school and under a lot of pressure either way and I think they are so \"mixed up\" emotionally trying to figure out if they are supposed to be real adults and old High school kids or if they can still be a little bit \"little\" yet, and this way, the whole bunch are the same age in the same position and are the most relaxed, at ease bunch I have seen in this age group. There does not seem so much \"need to keep up with the older crowd.\" Kinda hate to take him out till next June, but we really do not have any choice. Job situation here is practically \"nil\" except for nurses and they are always in demand but there is sure nothing for men. We are all anxious to get to San Diego. Strange, but that's the place Matt likes best and has always, so looks like we will end up there. Of course we have not seen Karen and Jim since last December, either, and I know they are going to see a big change on Doug and we are so anxious to see them. Suppose I had better go \"fine sand\" that cabinet and get the second coat of varnish on it and then all it needs is a catch to hold the door shut and a handle on it! Then I had better get at some of this \"packing\" business. Just had unpacked my cake decorating stuff and cookbooks and opened several boxes of sewing and craft stuff and I pack that stuff because I do a cute job of it. Lord only knows I have had enough practice!! Are they still whirlpooling you? and if so, does it seem to be doing anything for you? other than relaxing you? See by the Tribune that they are having a workshop for diabetes they sure would like to attend that, buttttt it is a \"too five piece\" away. Think this pen has about had it. It is \"dropping drops\" and I think I have as much ink on my hands as on the paper. Must get busy! She will send you our address, soon as we get one. Tell Signe that we will be expecting to see them when they come to the Escondido this winter and I will keep the coffee pot hot! I lost the Bickler's address she gave me, but no doubt can find it in the telephone directory when we get there. Happy Halloween! \n",

      "I'm washed and curled and under the dryer, so will use my time to good advantage. We got a letter from the University of California at Berkeley yesterday (mailed to us, but letter started \"Dear Richard\"). Anyway, it congratulated Richard on making the University \"Honors\" list and stating that they were extremely proud of him and showed concerted effort on his part, as very few undergraduates ever make the \"Honors\" list. He was real proud of it, anyway, and we were, too. There are over 10,000 students at Berkeley, but don't have any idea what the percentage is that makes \"honors\". Thought it was real nice of the dean to send us a letter, anyway. So often parents never hear what is going on in school, good or bad! We've had a little storm go through this area and Mutt only got partway up the mountain yesterday and it was snowing hard and his T-bird is just too low to get through too much snow, so he came back home. This morning he got up at five and drove out to Kingsley Air Force Base and caught a G.I. bus up the mountain. He called about 7:30 this morning and said it rained up there all night and the roads were clear and he could have gotten through with his car, but it's so blamed unpredictable and that blamed \"trail\" up there doesn't have road guards on the sides of the roads in case you skid, and he can't see risking his neck. He'd be okay if he had snow tires, but can't see buying snow tires when we'll only be here two more weeks, so guess it's up at 5 and catch the 6 a.m. bus. Talked to Rich on the phone last night and he'd been out to Treasure Island to apply for a job at the Officers Club and they said they needed help, but only hired Chinese, so that was out. He applied for a bookkeeping job through the University office and thought he had that about sewed up, (because they were hoping to find someone who understood Scandinavian language and they're hard to find) and he was best qualified for the \"bookkeeping\" part, but some blamed Norwegian came along and got that job! He laughed and said he was to go to Alameda Officers Club today to see about a job and maybe, just maybe, they'd be looking for someone who understood Spanish, Italian and English and he'd have it made! He sure was in good spirits, but he'd just gotten a copy of the \"honors\" letter, too, so suppose that helped boost his morale (even if he couldn't get a job because he wasn't Chinese or didn't speak Swedish or Norwegian!). Doug was sitting here yesterday morning working equations in Algebra and was stuck, so I said, \"Let me see that problem.\" I worked it for him and helped him with the rest of them and finally he looked at me so funny and said, \"Mother, when did you learn Algebra?\" I said, \"Oh, just the other day, 30 years ago.\" And he just looked \"awe-struck\" and I didn't let on at all that it was \"beginning\" Algebra and when he gets three or four pages farther in the book, he might discover that I couldn't work those!! Sure gonna let him think I'm \"smart\" just as long as I can!! Ha! They sure have a different approach to Math than we learned, and different terminology and when he starts talking about \"variables\", etc., I just have to say \"Forget the words and give me the problem\" and when I'd get it worked he'd understand how I did it, but it was much shorter than the way he did it.\" Have you been watching the World Series? Doug has a 25 cent bet on the Mets, and you'd think it was a million dollars!!  Haven't asked Mutt if he is in any \"pools\" this year. They usually have one going for $25.00 or so in the sqdn. but I don't know if he's in on any this year or not. Went to \"knit and sew\" class Tuesday and that gal put a cardigan sweater together like magic! Looks so easy! She sews on a \"Viking\" machine (made in Sweden) and it stitches a straight seam and overcasts seams at the same time and the \"pressure\" on the pressure foot is adjustable but looks like it'd take a mechanical genius to learn what to do with all the dials! Sure sews beautifully, though. Think I'm about \"dry\" and suppose I should get busy. Packers will be here two weeks from today! Ugh! \n",

Our address is 6306 Mt. Ackerman Drive, Claremont, CA 91711. She says it's off Highway 395 above Montgomery Field. It's three blocks from a Junior High, three blocks from a Senior High, and a couple blocks from a shopping center, 20 miles south of Escondido, 10 minutes drive from the \"Fee Folks\" (so Karen and I can have coffee once in awhile!), and guess that's about it. Has a built-in double oven gas range, carpeted living room, hall, master bedroom, 2 car garage and has a fenced backyard, so Tina will be happy. Rent is...$210.00 a month, plus $100.00 cleaning deposit that is totally refunded if place is left clean. Those kids have house hunted for three weeks, and while the rent is high, at least it's a house to move into, and get Doug right in school. Mutt got a call yesterday from some company in San Diego that just got a new Navy contract and they want Mutt's resume. Don't know how they even found out about him, but after Mutt got to talking to the personnel fellow awhile yesterday, he discovered that the personnel man was a retired Sergeant that worked for Mutt in Sage at Grand Forks. Small world! Don't know any more about the job, but if it isn't turned permanent, and in the San Diego area, we aren't even interested! It's training men on computers, very similar to what he's doing now. Wouldn't that be something if he didn't have to job hunt?? Karen has a job at the Marine Recruiting Depot, in Personnel, in the hiring and firing department, and loves it. Says the people are so nice to work with that it's pure joy to go to work. She gets less money than at the other job ($424.00 a month), but said those people at the conv. hospital were very difficult to work for, so she didn't mind losing that job, but it was just the underhanded method they used to hire and fire her. If they had told her to begin with that they only needed her for a few weeks, she wouldn't have minded, but they hired her, used her and then fired her on Friday when the new girl was due in on Monday. By law, they should have had to pay her two weeks severance pay, since they gave her no notice, but she's happy where she is now and glad to be away from the likes of them. Doug got your letter yesterday and was so thrilled over it. Course I died several times waiting for him to come home and open it so I could read it, too! Jane Lee Stuntebeck was over here for coffee yesterday afternoon and the letter was lying here on the table and she got such a kick out of my dying curiosity and said she was just as bad when her boys got letters from her parents. And she never opened their mail, either, but it sure was a long wait from the time the letter got there till the boys come home. She and Jim had been hunting yesterday morning and got two pheasants, so it wasn't a total loss. Doug's football team goes to Medford for a football game today, so he had to have a white shirt and tie, and they leave school at noon. Last time they went over there, they got home at 8:30 p.m. so it's a long day, but they stop at a Chuckwagon before they leave Medford and the school buys supper for all the boys, so that's nice. It's a \"smorgasbord\" type place and Doug said last time, \"Boy, do we ever eat good!!\" I'll bet they do. I'd hate to feed 22 boys that age very often! Landlady came by with a man to see the house (yesterday) and he rented it. Really enoyed your description of the view from where you were sitting in your wheelchair. I could see every bit of it, too! Even shuddered when you said it was starting to snow! Brrrr, I'm ready for warm weather. I've spent all morning cutting address labels off the magazines for \"change of address\" cards and hope I have those done again. Bet I've driven those Address Department people crazy with six different addresses in 14 months (Hamilton Air Force Base, Riverside, Colonial Heights, Keno, Klamath Falls, and now Claremont). Have to send \"post office\" cards to all the post office departments, too, so that mail that goes to Hamilton or Colonial Heights won't have to be forwarded all those places. Sure hope we \"stay put\" awhile now. Guess I'd better go out in that garage. I have opened so many boxes and taken a few things out before we knew we were leaving, and I think I have a bigger mess than I've ever had before. They'll re-pack all those boxes, but they do such a poor job and I'm apt to find a skate board and Christmas decorations and china and hammers and screwdrivers all packed together if I don't sort it all in different piles! They usually send one professional packer to do all the glassware and the other one is usually anybody that's available and they sure pack some doozies! Gosh, I gotta get busy! I'm so relieved to know we have a place to go into. That sure took a load off our shoulders. Be good and tell Signe Erickson we're right down the road from Escondido, on the same highway even! So let me know when to put the coffee pot on.\n",

      "Here I sit, on Doug's rolled up sleeping bag, waiting for the utility men to come (sometime between 8 and 12 am) and turn on the gas and electric. We got in here yesterday afternoon, took Karen and Jim out to dinner last night and we yakked and yakked. We might stay with them tonight, but stayed in a motel near here last night because I had to be here early for the utility people. Mutt just left for Beverly Hills for a job interview at 1 p.m. The job isn't in Beverly Hills, just the head office. Sure anxious to hear what they have to offer and where. We're ideally located here, three blocks from junior high, high school, and big shopping center. The house is clean, except for the stove and hood above it and that's enough to make you sick! There are actually strings of grease hanging (about 1-1/2\" long) from the vent so it is the worst I've seen yet, but I can't use the stove till I clean that up. The house is five years old and I'd bet money that the fan hasn't been cleaned since it was installed. I'm beginning to lose heart with cleaning other people's messes! Had to put up a $100.00 cleaning deposit, too! Oh well, it's a roof over our head, and that's the important thing. We're only renting this on a month to month basis, no lease, so that's good, because if Mutt's job is too far to commute, then we'll likely move in January again and if we do I hope we buy  so we have to stay. We're both tired of all this moving! When Mutt checked in at SDC in Santa Monica yesterday, they offered him a job in Dayton, Ohio, and Mutt turned it down flat. Said he's made too many moves in one year for the company's benefit and he just couldn't see it. Karen and Jim are happy as larks. She sure enjoys her job at the Marine Recruiting Depot Bx. She interviews job applicants and then checks on their references and says it's so interesting. She interviewed a \"soul brother\"  yesterday and his name was Douglas Jones! Then she called his present place of employment, they said they couldn't give him any recommendation because he was under investigation, but they wouldn't say what for, of course, and Karen couldn't give him a job because of him being under investigation. She even had to send a form to the telephone company in Riverside to get her own reference cleared and that just came back yesterday stating she was a \"very fine\" employee. She really got a charge out of that because they fired her because she lost too much sick time when she had Mono and Hepatitis and they made her come back to work too early and she a relapse and missed more time, so they up and fired her. 'Course that was just before she and Jimmy were married and she worked for that house trailer company ever since, so maybe they even forgot who she was. Soon as the utility people get through here I'm going to find a pay phone and try to get a hold of Tom Shuler. He graduates November 7th (I didn't know the Navy celebrates Pat's birthday too!!) and I got a letter from Frances yesterday with instructions from Tim as \"where to stand to hear the choir\", \"what time to get there\", etc. but I'd like to chat with him by phone, to be sure we find him after they're through singing. We have a phone number 278-5460 but the phone won't be in until Thursday. Our furniture won't be here until Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. The weather is really ideal. The sun is shining and I don't even have to wear a sweater. Now you know it must be warm. Last night Jim and Karen took us for a ride and we went down by the \"water\" and the lights were just beautiful, and the air smelled so good. We stayed in Santa Monica Sunday night because Mutt had to be there at SDC at 9 a.m. Monday. We got in there about 4:30 p.m. and boy, was I glad to get off that freeway! Traffic was thick on all five lanes and people changing lanes like crazy, and Doug and I trying to keep track of that T-bird and Mutt ahead of us!! Ye gots!! Really felt qualified to get a crash helmet, paint a number on the side of the Merc, and head for the stock car races, as a driver!! We had supper and checked into a motel and were in bed watching TV by 7:15. \"Yours truly\" fell asleep at 7:30 and never woke up until 9 a.m.!! Haven't slept so soundly in years! Must have been good for me. Remember when I was hit by a thrown baseball bat at a 4H picnic when I was about 14 years old?? Well that spot just below the knees has always stayed tender and never bothered unless I tried to get at a top cupboard and \"stand\" on the counter on my knees, and then those spots hurt, so I just didn't do that, nor pray too hard too long on m'knees, but after I'd driven about two or three hours straight, I kept getting \"shots of lightning\" through those spots. We'd stop to \"gas up\", and it'd be fine for awhile again and it's gone completely today. Isn't that funny after about 32 years?? Hot dog!! Must be old age creepin' up! Heh! Heh! Heh! 11 a.m. Electric and gas men just came. I'd better clean that cotton pickin' stove and get some shelf paper on. Will write later. By the way, this address is Clairemont, California and the zip is 92111.The post office gave me the wrong zip because I gave them the wrong spelling of Claremont. \n",

      "Don't hear from anyone up that away, so I do wonder about you. Our offer to bring you to live with us was sincere, and had I known it was going to cause a family ruckus, maybe we'd never have mentioned it. Have been cautioned not to even mention it to you, because all it does is upset you, so henceforth I won't mention it again, but just wanted you to know that we still do want you and if you ever decide you want to try it, the spot is here for you and we'll welcome you with open arms and all you have to do is talk to the girls up there and O.W. and we'll all take it from there. I won't mention it again in my letters, but after not hearing from anyone anymore, I didn't want you to think we offered a \"fake\" offer. It was genuine and still is and believe me, we had no idea everyone would get so upset over it all. I won't mention it again in any of my letters, but had to get it off my chest that you'd know, we weren't trying to cause trouble, when we made our offer. I go to the dentist today at 11 A.M. Yuk! Could think of many places I'd rather go, butttt can't put it off forever. I work tomorrow and Thursday at a Convalescent Hospital near here. It's nothing permanent, but actually I'm looking forward to a couple days of it. Means a little change in \"getting up\" hours, and Doug has already asked for cold cereal with bananas for breakfast the next two days, so he can sleep later. Irene Erickson Bickler called Sunday P.M. They had a bunch of young people (from the church) down at the skating rink here, so she called and gabbed while they were standing by as chaperones. Rod called Sunday night, too. He's flying as \"Navigator\" to Texas some place this weekend. He sure enjoys the \"air.\" (Me.. Put m'feet on the ground, please!) The Air Force Academy Choir is singing 6 or 8 concerts in the San Francisco area March 8th, so he will see Rich that weekend. That is, if Rich can get any time off. He's doing tax work, so it's a busy, busy time for that. We just sent Uncle Sam another $500.00 besides all they withheld. That \"surcharge\" goofed up everyone. Then that blamed Mark made over $2600.00 since June at Holiday Inn so we had to drop him as a dependent even though we supported him totally until June and paid his car insurance, we couldn't match that figure soooo that hurt us. We still have to figure California, Oregon, and Virginia state taxes. All that \"changing states\" hurts you tax wise. We're so anxious to hear when we'll get our house. Hope it's in March so Rod can help us move. He always seems to come home at the right time. When he called Sunday, he said to be sure to tell him as soon as he had a new address because he'd hurry right in and give that cute girl in the housing office his new address. He said he stopped to tell her that he'd be in to change his home address again soon. Guess she's a pretty cute chick. He doesn't mind stopping often, but we can't keep moving just to accommodate him! Ha! Had a nice long letter from Frances last week. She writes the best letters, and it's fun keeping up with all her kids. Sure would be nice if Tim got a West Coast assignment from school this month. He sure is a nice boy! By the way, is John Drege still going with Ann? And what's new with Maria and her bump on her head? And what does anyone hear from Frank and Lil? Irene said her mother said they'd sure enjoyed their days there over New Years. And how's Cora Crook this winter? Well, suppose I'd better go get dressed and make my bed at least, before I head for the dentist. Sure think about you often, especially on the balmy summer days, and we have lots of them. Weather man said, \"Possible showers\" today and it's cloudy so it might be right. Mutt's job is fine. He's the only male teller right now and his boss can't figure out what has happened, because his window is always crowded and he's been handling $12,000 to $17,000.00 a day, and the other tellers are averaging 5 to 7 thousand. He tallies out okay at the end of the day okay, too, so maybe it's just that people would rather deal with an old reliable looking man than a young girl?? He says it wouldn't make him feel badly at all if some of them would go to the other windows. The bank is situated in an area where there are a lot of retirement-age people, and he enjoys dealing with them and is very patient with them, so maybe that's his drawing card. Anyway, they're working the stuffing out of him and he's happy in spite of it all. Mailman just brought the mail. A White Front Store Ad! Will have to look it over closely to see how much money I have to spend to save money! Ha. Gotta run! \n",

      "Should be scrubbing my kitchen floor and doing some baking but let's thee and me chat a little first. Mark and Chris are flying in sometime tomorrow and will be till Sunday. Ruth and Al Higgins (neighbors in Virginia) are in LA and they plan to come this weekend, too, and then last night Rich called and said he and Pet are going to a wedding in LA Sat. morning and will be here about 3 P.M. Sat. Have no idea where I'm going to bed people down, but will figure something out. There's lots of floor space in the living room! Hospital wanted me to work Sat., too, but that's out. Think we're going to let our house go in Lemon Grove, too. We only have $100.00 deposit on it, which we'll have to forfeit, but the people next door have a big German Shepard dog and our bedroom is on that side of the house with only about 3 feet from their chain link fence and they fenced off that area for the dog and our only bedroom window would be right next to it and frankly, it smells!! We'd never be able to have our bedroom window open. We're disappointed, but glad we don't have any more money in it. The \"house for sale\" ads are several pages long in the paper now, I imagine, by the time this next big cut of over 100 military bases comes up, there'll be many more before the end of the June. There's been a definite drop in house prices here in the past month, too. One house that I looked at a month ago was $23,950, and I see the same house listed for $20,950, in Sunday's paper, so I'm sure we can do better with our money in a couple months and have later payments. Mutt's back is back in good position again. Think we've discovered the secret to it. If we get him started on \"Robaxin\" right away (muscle relaxant) and use Bengay and heat, then he can stand at work all day and make it O.K., as long as he stays on the \"heat\" as soon as he gets home till time to go to work again. Sadie's maternity clothes came yesterday and Karen was so tickled over them. Don't think she has to do a thing to them but press them and wear them. I went to the Marine Corps Recruit depot and had lunch with Karen yesterday, and brought the clothes to her here. Went to the dentist yesterday and had a gold screw (and porcelain? or plead or something colored\") put in my front tooth. Then he worked out a \"plan\" of all the things that should be done and then said, or rather he sent his receptionist in to tell me that the total bill would be $800++... He wants to bridge in a back tooth that's been missing since 194? and I'm not going back to him. I just had them xrayed and checked in May and I'm sure if I had $800.00 worth of work that needed doing, some of it would have showed up then, wouldn't you think?? Anyhow, I\"m not going to go through all that until I've had another dental opinion or something starts to hurt. They charge $10.00 to clean them and $10.00 for another appt. to do any sealing and every dentist before has said my teeth have little cleaning and sealing to be done and never have they required 2 appts., because the sealing takes less than 10 mins. and about 5 more to clean them. Think this guy just has a racket going. People who smoke usually need a lot of sealing done, but I got out my dental mirror when I got home and looked 'em over good and be darned if I can see what there is to seal, even with the dental magnifying mirror! Anywhooooo, he ain't for me!! Got the Tribune yesterday. There was a picture of several groups of \"debators\" and one was \"Marilyn McClintock\". Is that John's girl? There was a Beckles boy too, don't remember his first name and Kitty and Bennett Hutchinson's boy. Sure fun to see the pictures of these kids, (all group up, though!). Oh, Oh - there's the mailman across the street! If I hurry, sign this off, he will take it when he comes by here in about 5 mins. Gotta run! \n",

      "Margie called me Saturday night and I'm soooooo excited over her report she gave me! I know you'll enjoy all the activity there and I'm sure it will plainly \"poop\" you at first, but it's progress, Mom, and your strength will come back. Just to be out of that bed and doing things with other people gave you a lift, I bet! Margie had started to write me a letter and then she said, \"Ah, heck, I've got too much to tell\" so she called. It really made my day! We have two ladies on Station I (where I work right now) who have gone from bed to a walker since I started there in February and we're so excited about them. One has an artificial leg and can now walk the length of the hall and back with a walker. The other had a stroke months ago and just got started with the walker this week. We don't have anything to do with the physiotherapy part of it (and I'm really interested in that) but once PT gets them moving a bit, then we pick it up from there and keep them moving in the walkers several times a day between therapy sessions. It is so thrilling to see them progress and see the hope come back in their faces. So much can be done, but so many facilities simply aren't equipped or staffed to accommodate treatment, so I'm really, really thrilled over Margie's news! (By the way! Hear tell that you wear your bra inside out!! Ha Ha Ha!! Ya got it on, and that's what matters!! Backwards or forwards? Who cares!! It's on!!) Rich called last night to tell us he got a scholarship for $800.00, only it has a few stipulations. It's for the fall, spring and winter quarter and he wanted to go to school this summer, so is going to see if they'll give him part of it so he can go to school all summer. He has permission from the Dean to take an overload this summer and if he can do that, will graduate in December instead of June. He's on e of 14 students in the Dean's \"student advisory board\", so says it's really interesting and the dean gave him the overload O.K. and no questions asked. It would mean that Rich would go to school 4 1/2 hours a day, five days a week and they figure 1 1/2 hours of homework per class so he wouldn't be able to work, but he'd graduate (with honors if he maintains his present scholastic average) in 3 1/2 years instead of 4 years, so he's sure hoping he can do it. Most students in California colleges take 4 1/2 years to graduate now, because of classes being so overcrowded but he's known exactly which way he wanted to go, planned his schedule early and managed to get all his requirements as scheduled so far. If he doesn't go to school after December, then the scholarship money for those months is cancelled, of course. They dole it out a school quarter at a time (not a 25 center quarter! Ha!). We'll have to finance this summer session if he doesn't get the scholarship to cover it, but he and Peggy want to get married during Thanksgiving weekend, so if he could finish school in December, it'd be clearer sailing for them. Rod called Sunday night. They're going to sing at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. again this month and there's something pending that they might sing for President Nixon in the White House, but all the Red Tape on that isn't worked out yet, so he might and might not. they sang in Petersburg last month and after the performance had \"liberty\" till 2A.M. They were meandering back to where they were staying, had plenty of time to get back and he was a little ways behind the boys ahead of him and two big white boys jumped him. He sent them both to the hospital and said he doubted that either of them would have families and it would be a long time till their noses healed up. Then he ran and caught up with the rest of the guys. He said, \"Talk about scared! And if he hadn't been trained in \"Unarmed Combat\" procedures heaven only knows what they'd have to me.\" 'Course that's hwy Mark took \"karate\" lessons, too, because he said he knew he'd never be a big  man, and a small man on the streets anymore doesn't have a china mans chance if you don't know \"self defense\" procedures. Forgot to tell you, Rich said the Berkeley campus was really riled up yesterday, took. He said he came out of class and didn't know which way to go to get out of there to go home. Finally, just hurried out and hurried along the sidewalk trying to get out of there and still a policeman hit him on the legs with a billy club and a couple classmates got whacked across the head with them just trying to get home. He's right in the middle of mid-term exams, but said if things didn't look better today he wasn't sure he'd go to class, mid-terms or no midterms. He said the University police are pretty good and only go after those throwing rocks or the leaders of the mess, but they had sheriffs in there from Newark, Hayward and Alamede Co., and they were swinging at everyone. Also said they were using a gas call \"CS gas\" that has been outlawed by the Geneva Conference. It's different from regular tea gas in that it causes irritation to eyes whereas the regular tear gas causes the eyes to water and then water will rinse it out, but this other CS Gas doesn't rinse out right away and really irritate the eyes. He just might miss school a few days if this keeps up. He said it was really scary to see what is actually going on there, but it's all over the Country now. Well, it's 11:15 and I'd better go get my uniforms in the washer. Go to work again tomorrow, and I'm breaking in 2 new R.N's to \"procedures.\" One is a negro R.N. from N.Y., very pretty girl, Mrs. Norman, the other is a younger R.N. from Portland, a Mrs. Erickson and she hasn't worked for 10 years since she graduated, so there's a little \"brushing up\" to catch up on there, too, but I'll stay on full time for a couple more weeks, anyway, and then go back to 3 days and every other weekend. Know you'll be busy, busy, busy there and no doubt you'll get tired but it will be a \"good kind\" of tired! \n",

      "I am all beautiful again (Thanks to Krohn Drug's Hair color) and under the drier. Have a pile of socks to mend, at one elbow and a cup of coffee at the other. Guess which one will get attention first!! Karen and Jim got moved into an apartment Saturday so we went over and helped them unpack stuff. They had been in Riverside just a little over a week when Jim got this job with the county here, so they are pretty tired of moving. Karen is due day after tomorrow and if she has not gotten busy by Thursday when Jim goes back in the field, then she will come back over here and stay till Jim gets back the next Thursday. She is so awkward right now, and was really pooped by Saturday evening. We took a chest of drawers over to them yesterday so they would have a place to put clothes. We were over at our neighbor next door for steak last night and it was really delicious. They have a daughter 13 and she and Doug spent the evening trying to avoid each other! Us \"old folks\" really got a kick out of their \"escape and evasion\" tactics! I imagine Doug will change his ideas about \"girls in general\" soon, but right now they are still a big pain. We are still waiting for a Virginia appraisal and approval of our bid on that house. They sure take their old sweet time on things. We had a nice secure lockup last week in this house we are renting and they finally got everything opened up and running again by 10:30 at night. Floors was a mess, though. Mark called last Friday from Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois. He sure sounded in good spirits. He is hoping to finish his school in July instead of August, and that means he will get back to Terra Linda and his Chris again. Her grandmother flew to Chicago to visit a son and Mark went in to see her and they went out to dinner and he had such a good time. Had a letter from Marg and one from Sadie this week. Sadie sent school pictures of all her school kids and one of Sally Fay, too. Susie sure looks a lot like Sandy Drege did at that age. Margie's letters sound so encouraging about your progress, mom, and I have a lot of hope for your walking again. It takes terrific fortitude to rewalk after you have been down so long, but I would bet you can do it. I really got a thrill out of seeing our patients progress. It is slow, but we have several who were completely bedridden when I first saw them in January and who have progressed to a walker now. We have a Mrs. Ferretti who is now able to get on her feet by herself from her wheelchair and I asked her last week if she could dance an Irish jig for me yet and she said \"Well, not yet, but pretty soon I will show you!\". She is the sweetest person and was so depressed when she first came in but she is pleased as punch over her progress! She walks slowly in a walker and she got the giggles so bad the other day that she had to sit down in her walker awhile till she got over the giggles. She has done about a complete \"turn-a-round\" personalitywise since she came in and it has taken lots and lots of work and perseverance on her part, and her family is so excited over her progress. Think I have a tendency to compare their progress with you, and I just feel more and more sure that you can walk again. From everything I have heard from there, they must have a terrific \"Crew\" there in Grand Forks. I am sure there are times when you wish they would do more things for you, but it is so important that you do everything you can for yourself, because it is the only way those sleepy muscles can be reactivated. Margie says you are really working hard and she says she sees improvement every time she sees pace! That is really great! It is time for old Doug the bug to come in from school. I am going to try a new recipe for spare ribs and sauerkraut, cooked with canned apples and tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Hope old Mutt and Doug appreciate my culinary attempts! They are really not sauerkraut eaters, but thought I would try this and see if it is any more favorable. Must run, gotta gas up the car, too! It is sitting on \"E\" but think I have enough fumes in the tank to get me to the gas station at the end of the block. Much, much love and hope you will soon be kicking up your heels like a young colt! \n",

really rushed place there are about or students on first floor in the mornings but we have several american mexican nurse aides who are dandies beginning to pick up little spanish too no not much but few words here and there last sunday mutt and were loafing around here and it was so quiet and the house was stuffy and the johnsons were gone and the front yard needed raking quite badly so we donned old clothes and out we went and cleaned up the yard and it really looks super ahem anyway the johnsons came home and got such big kick out of it didn go to work this morning because yesterday afternoon uncle sam informed mutt that they were leaving on plane at pm today for maneuvers in california and that he is to be sergeant of the guard and that he was also to report at this morning to be bonded because he is to be responsible for cash other gi and all the radar equipment that is going out there for it sooooo mrs johnson called the hospital and told them that mrs jones was ill today and would not be able to work that was at am this morning sooooo we went back to sleep and didn wake up till at she knocked on the door and said that she had made toast and coffee for us and that there were preserves and fruit juice on the table and she had also written note and put it in the bathroom just in case we weren awake when she left at nine the note read betty dear have fixed the toast and coffee for you two sweet children you will find cream in the refrigerator if you want some sweets put jar of jam on the table hope you enjoy it all by yourselves mrs am sure you had rather be alone this morning than go out to eat wasn that sweet of her you see there are no kitchen privileges with the room so it was all out of the goodness of her heart they just came home now and stuck their noses in here and mr johnson said anything we can do for the sick and lonely mrs johnson had told him about my being sick this morning and he got quite kick out of it we really had to hustle around here because my man had his od in the tailor shop getting them altered and they were to be ready at noon so he rushed down there to push them along little and packed his clothes and washed and mended some socks for him had to finish mending one on the way to the field this pm he took me to the field with him but didn stay to see the plane take off because he had so many things to attend to anyway now he will be gone until about the th of november hope he at least back here by december because that his th birthday and he must have birthday cake with candles birthdays and christmas have always meant so much at home and by golly if can manage to make it the same in our little family surely going to try anyway johnny and sandy are sitting over on the dresser looking this way and sure do wish they just step out of the pictures and toddle over here miss those little monkeys and wish we could get home to see them before they get too big of course don think they ll ever be too big but if they ve grown too much won recognize them ll bet big boss john has changed lot too golly if keep on here this old gal will be homesick again and that would never do because right now she has no one to tell her troubles to and no one troubles to hear and that bad can bother the landlord and landlady with little things like that how are the kidless coming with their music lessons when are they going to start the faylet orchestra with all that music they ought to be able to do something like that shouldn they how about that pat sal and mugs sure am glad to hear that frankie is doing so well in school and hope he keeps it up always knew there was something other than sawdust in that noggin of his and glad he found it does fay room with him or do they have separate rooms oh yes and how is helen now think about her so much with her three little ones and have wondered if she ever started putting some fat on her bones they really have done wonders with their little family and hope we can do as well with our family if we ever have one so far no family but rather not have any while we re bouncing around the country as much as we are just think september in california october and
